Our methodology how we did it For Proteus, Apexon worked across all 3 stages of the digital lifecycle on multiple projects. Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Be digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Launch & Experiment Automate & Accelerate Be Intelligent & Autonomous Launch & Experiment Enable digital adoption in a quick and agile manner Apexon Exploration Pod worked with the Proteus team for ideation & blueprinting. The Blueprinting phase focused on user interviews, personas, analysis, brainstorming, scenario identification and assumption validation to translate ideas into MVP solution requirements and UI/UX design . Apexon also designed the communication mechanism between the patch, Mobile Apps & Backend. The team also designed & detailed solution architecture and defined the KPIs to track the project. Apexon team then set up a framework for capturing actionable project intelligence (matrices) aligned to the project KPIs. Apexon team used in-house accelerators such as IoT companion App framework & BLE Framework coupled with our methodologies to provide rapid prototyping and MVPs. Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Apexon Execution Pod consisting of Backend Squad, Mobile Development Squad & Web Development Squad started maturing the product as per the defined roadmap. The development team added new UI features, enhanced communication mechanisms, fixed defects and integrated with Google Analytics & Swrve SDK and New Relic to capture analytics data. The QA team worked on end-to-end system integration tests involving Patch, Cloud, App & Backend. Apexon also automated test scripting and maintenance during sprint-cycle. Apexon tested BLE and app performance on devices and created real-life test scenarios for the mobile app in use with medication intake in compliance with FDA protocols. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time As a part of continuous evolution, Apexon Execution Pod focused on helping Proteus grow by enabling other innovators to develop applications that could work with the Proteus digital pill & patch. In addition to app enhancements, the Execution Pod developed two SDKs: a BLE-based framework to receive, parse and store patch data in a database, and a Design Mobile Application UI. Apexon also enabled  the continuous tracking of KPIs via the continuous collection of select operational and business data from the project and the abiloity to generate insights from the collected data. The challenge A complex vision Proteus’ product vision was incredibly compelling but executing on that vision was also complex.  The company’s core competence was on the frontend – with breakthrough integrations of technology with medicine and in-patient care. However, they had several critical needs on the backend: Management of regulatory compliance requirements within software product development Short lead times for product launches in multiple geographies Time-to-market challenges that prevented proper discipline across the product lifecycle Bluetooth (BLE) connectivity across multiple devices Greater control of cost of technology infrastructure; desire to move to an on-demand model The ability to scale quickly with the increase in the number of connected medical devices and patient networks The Solution Solving one of the toughest digital engineering challenges Apexon worked with the company across the entire delivery lifecycle: Application Development Apexon enabled the mobile application to communicate continuously via BLE with the patch worn by the patient. Apexon also supported the company on several other development projects including the middleware for the core company application (both Android and iOS), as well as the web frontend portal for the standard patient application. The development team added new UI features, enhanced communication mechanisms, and fixed defects. It also added new features and improved existing features in the Patient & Provider App in a 2-week development sprint. The team worked on the Integration with Google Analytics & Swrve SDK to capture analytics data and with New Relic to capture Application Crush details. Software Verification & Validation Apexon created an end-to-end process to test and QA the entire service offering across the end-to-end application lifecycle. This included: Manual testing of the mobile app Automated testing and QA of the connection of the frontend, backend and middleware Real-life scenarios for testing the mobile app (Patch testing apparatus), physical motion (Step, Incline), medication intake, heartbeat, etc. in addition to generating FDA compliant protocols and documents Apexon also configured & broke BLE signals using Hoffman Box for the interruption testing and the app performance on devices – CPU, Memory usage as a part of Performance Testing . Systems Integration & Device Expansion Apexon set-up a test center to replicate how the systems would operate and communicate with each other in real life. This included end to end integration tests involving Patch, Cloud, App & Backend. Apexon automated test scripting and maintenance during sprint-cycle. The team was able to automate 600 test cases per platform daily for regression tests Cloud Migration Built a  ‘Gap-Analysis’ matrix of Proteus’ cloud requirements and recommended  AWS as the best choice.

Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time Apexon re-architected the client server interaction & front end to enhance performance and enable client side configurability with custom localization support. The challenge TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR DIGITAL International SOS faced multiple challenges in pursuit of its digital initiatives. Some were common across multiple projects; others were unique to specific projects and offerings. The four of biggest challenges they faced are: The company’s business model was based on serving multi-national companies whose executives traveled all over the world. As such, all services had to be available and functional globally and integrated with traveler analytics and demographics systems. This required that any new service be available on all primary mobile platforms at the same time, on any operating system and supported device, in any geography. Limited in-house testing capabilities made it very difficult to address the large-scale QE effort required to get quality apps and services to market, globally, in a timely manner. International SOS was using a paper-based system to manage responses to pandemic situations. To digitize these processes, it needed to conduct a complete requirements assessment, define and configure multi-level action plans, create processes for making changes to those plans, and improve its ability to monitor the current status of the crisis and provide client employees with self-service access to critical information. The International SOS Travel Tracker was an app used to monitor traveler location for safety. It was dependent on a single communication gateway for all forms of communications like email, SMS, text to voice, etc. This created a single point of failure and a threat to client safety. There were also several core operational challenges. For example, too many unplanned technology deployments were being pushed into production, making it difficult to keep projects on schedule and assure service quality. There was no Continuous Integration process in place and its development infrastructure was insufficient. The Solution The Complete Digital Engineering Solution As part of this engagement, Apexon deployed five key solutions for International SOS: structured approach Apexon established a structured approach to QE that involved: A comprehensive testing strategy to cover overall approach, tools, targets and the timing of test activities for any application Core testing services – functional, regression and usability Advanced testing services – performance, scalability, security and vulnerability A 3-phase approach for test automation alongside development sprints UI functional automated testing This effort identified critical gaps in existing QA processes and dramatically increased the rate of defect discovery. An automation framework for shared services automated a significant portion of the test footprint, accelerating cycle time and improving service quality. leveraged digital expertise Apexon leveraged its digital expertise to replace existing paper-based systems with a new electronic health portal. The solution included: An iterative development model to incorporate evolving requirements Detailed blueprinting and design, enabling quick prototypes for approval Continuous collaboration with geographically distributed teams and experts Use of robust CI frameworks The development process was able to incorporate continuous feedback without slowing time-to-market while also making effective use of time and effort already invested. Continuous Integration To address the core operational challenges in International SOS’ software delivery process, Apexon deployed Continuous Integration using a Jenkins Framework. The solution included: A joint architected CI flow and objectives with emphasis on code coverage to improve unit and regression testing Automated test suites used a Selenium framework Jenkins reports enabled better decision making and planning This approach improved delivery quality and process efficiency, accelerating time-to-market for new services and preventing rework. independent communication engine Apexon conceived and developed an independent communication engine for all International SOS applications – both internal and external. This included: A flexible and modern single-page architecture with popular frameworks like Backbone, Require and Marionette Re-architecting the client server interaction & front end to enhance performance and enable client-side configurability and custom localization support Responsive UI/UX for web, mobile & tablet (single code base) Agile Dev & QE practices with CI enable iterative roll out and adaptation This solution reduced costs significantly by eliminating 3rd party map solution and requirements for custom development. It also improved Map UI performance by up to 40%. global digital travel risk management Apexon partnered with International SOS to migrate its global digital travel risk management product offering from legacy data centers to a modern hybrid AWS cloud platform. This included: An AWS Cloud Migration Assessment of International SOS’ product portfolio to determine migration scope and effort A complete AWS migration strategy (re-host, re-platform, retain, re-factor, retire and re-purchase) in alignment with program goals and objectives An upgrade of legacy OS and database servers in preparation for migration Review of their AWS cloud architecture and collaboration with International SOS infrastructure and networking teams to finalize LLD and HLD cloud architecture/blueprints Validation of International SOS’ high availability objectives, and development and execution of automated test scripts Serving as the central point for coordinating the delivery effort across multiple client and external vendors, proactively identifying risks, resolving technical issues, and ensuring key business objectives are met.

Engagements included development of a merchant portal and digital wallet; data migration and analytics for B2B  applications for a platform for banks; integrating multiple acquired products; and supporting the company’s technology User Experience team. Apexon helped address three core challenges across all of these projects. Data Analytics & Cloud Infrastructure The B2B applications for the banking platform required deep data analytics and infrastructure capabilities that could help banks target the right partners and suppliers and share data back and forth. Integration & Testing of Acquired Products The company has made multiple acquisitions across the globe, requiring integration and comprehensive functional and non-functional testing to bring these products onto a common platform for customers. UX Design & Development The company prides itself on offering its customers modern and intuitive user experiences. And it values user empathy as the foundation of a healthy design process. But it simply did not have the right resources to deliver on them. It needed additional expertise to develop key user insights and identify user pain points, inform and validate design decisions, and measure success through UX research using Design Thinking and user-centered design methodologies. Making all these challenges even more difficult was a critical resource crunch at the company in the face of tight timeframes to deliver on its goals. Bringing in new resources that did not understand the company’s technical environment and ecosystem would have only extended the process and risked the quality of the end deliverables. Some of its specific deliverable requirements included: Acquired product integration and testing UX vision for a suite of B2B products UI design standardization UX measurement strategy Engaging UX into Scaled Agile Framework product development Framework for estimating UX capacity Establishing a mature UX research practice for a program The Solution Key involvement from planning to execution As mentioned above, Apexon had a long history with the company. Our technical resources have been involved in the planning and delivery of multiple digital products and services for the company. The combination of Apexon’s UX/UI development, Cloud, and Quality Engineering expertise and in-depth knowledge of the company’s technical environment addressed the big gaps holding the company’s digital initiatives back.

      "Simplified Development Lifecycle with Universally-applicable Component Library - Apexon  Empowering Development through Framework-Agnostic Component Libraries Success Story Healthcare Empowering Development through Framework-Agnostic Component Libraries Apexon streamlines application development with a best-aligned framework to maintain compatibility with a single-source-of-truth component library Download This established healthcare organization was struggling to break away from the front-end framework on which its legacy applications were created. The client felt compelled to maintain future development in the same framework as their existing applications to ensure compatibility of their proposed component library. Apexon recommended a different approach – advising the company to empower its front-end developers to build future applications with whatever framework was best-aligned with the specific application and business requirements. Named 2021 Winner in the BIG Award for Business Named in SaaS 1000, Official List Of Top 1000 SaaS Companies, Launches 2Q’18 List Backed by Asurion the Results Key Outcomes Flexible Development Environment Increased Efficiency; Less Technical Debt Improved Developer Satisfaction Our methodology how we did it Apexon works with companies across the digital lifecycle. Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Be digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Launch & Experiment Automate & Accelerate Be Intelligent & Autonomous Launch & Experiment Enable digital adoption in a quick, and agile manner Apexon helped create a more flexible development environment – Decoupling the component library and design system from application frameworks offered a highly flexible development environment. Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Apexon created development environment for easy integration and consumption within target applications. This new approach also enabled big gains in development efficiency and increased developer satisfaction, not to mention mitigating the company’s technical debt. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time The challenge Simplify the development lifecycle The client was maintaining several legacy applications and wanted to build out a component library to assist in the development of several new applications. Development teams were not committed to the existing front-end framework for the new applications, but feared component library incompatibly. Developers simply wanted the option to use whichever front-end framework best suited each project. However, key stakeholders didn’t want teams reinventing component libraries every time a framework change was made. Both sides were dedicated to efficiency, but from very different perspectives. Many organizations were looking to maintain consistent branding across applications using a centralized component library. This would reduce overall feature design and development time. However, with projects located around the world with many different teams, there were bound to be differing opinions about which framework best suited the needs of the team. The Solution A new approach to improve development efficiency & developer retention Apexon recommended empowering development teams with a framework-agnostic component library with the help of Direflow – a React to Web Component transpiler. While this tool ultimately bound the component library to a front-end framework, the team felt this sacrifice was worth the freedom to build out future applications in whatever framework they felt fit best. Apexon has found that providing developers the creative freedom that they need improves efficiency and happiness, ultimately yielding accelerated feature timelines and improved developer retention. With this in mind, the team focused on delivering a universally-applicable component library with three key criteria: Universally applicable, regardless of application’s front-end framework Easy integration and consumption within target applications Support for quick and easy enhancements to component library, yet adherent to semantic versioning to mitigate introduction of breaking changes Marketing, Sales, & Service Execution Criteria two and three were the easiest to solve, as the team had abundant prior experience in building out component libraries. Much of the support for consumption and simple enhancements was sourced from the implementation of the component library as a symbolically linked repository using npm link. The team considered options such as Bit , but ultimately determined there to be little value to individual, semantically-versioned components. Publishing and consumption as an npm package afforded a solution naturally conducive to semantic versioning, and paired with some node module best practices, ensured no breaking changes propagated to consuming applications. Application Buildout Criterion one was the project outlier and required the most deliberation. Digital demographics indicated that the majority of traffic would be sourced from modern devices operating with modern browsers. With this information in hand, the team recognized Web Components as an excellent solution for core users while support for targeted legacy browser versions could be obtained through polyfills. Currently though, developing and maintaining vanilla Web Components is not well supported. Many integrated development environments (IDEs) and tools supporting the concept of component libraries rely on a front-end framework like React or Angular to be in place. If the team hoped to present the component library through something like Styleguidist or Storybook , vanilla Web Components weren’t the answer. React’s front end framework addressed this issue head on. How it works Use the power of React to create your component Build it, then use it and share it as a native Web Component Source: Direflow The impact of the new development framework has been significant A More Flexible Development Environment Decoupling the component library and design system from application frameworks offered a highly flexible development environment. Freedom To Choose Tools Teams no longer felt compelled to architect applications with a front-end framework simply because someone had previously committed them to it. Instead, they were empowered to elect the tools which best matched application requirements and best aligned with their interests. In addition to the increased flexibility, this new approach also enabled big gains in development efficiency and increased developer satisfaction, not to mention mitigating the company’s technical debt. \n",

Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Apexon helped The Father’s Table streamline content management system via new sales portal. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time The challenge Streamlining the user experience As The Father’s Table added new products, services, and school lunch programs over time, the website became difficult to navigate. Specific product information was not easily accessible. This created a number of challenges for both the company and its website users, including the heaviest users of the site: the brokers. Product Visibility Brokers were unable to locate the product information they needed (product images, nutritional and packaging information, etc.) to effectively promote the company’s offerings to their retailers. Manual Processes Very little could be conducted online, forcing brokers to communicate every single one of their needs and wait for those materials to be delivered to them. Poor Content Management Capabilities This made it difficult and time intensive for Father’s Table staff to keep the product content up to date, further emphasizing the problems outlined above. A Lack of Privacy Policies or Terms of Use This created legal issues for the company. The Solution A site redesign with an intuitive UI & efficient sales portal Apexon’s Digital Experience team started by creating a taxonomy and site design for Father’s Table products based on different category types. This made it easier for users to find the exact information they needed. In addition, a new sales portal gave the sales team and brokers the ability to sign in and download product information such as pictures, labels, and specs from a central location. This eliminated the time spent waiting for product information so they could better serve their retailer customers. It also streamlined the efforts for Father’s Table staff members responding to those requests. The portal provided the sales team and brokers an easier login process that did not require a VPN to access information, too. This freed up time and eliminated confusion in communication across all departments. Key highlights of the solution include: A central online location Containing all the product and ordering information required by the Father’s Table sales team, brokers, and end-users Streamlined content management system enabled Father’s Table staff to easily updated the site at any time with new offerings, product information, and high resolution product images. This also minimized time-sensitive dependencies and freed up staff to spend time on higher-value activities A more effective marketing & sales presence Leading to higher sales and profits for Father’s Table Apexon also added a privacy policy and terms of use to the website, eliminating any legal liabilities. “We always felt like Apexon’s number one priority. It really made a difference when we would ask questions and no one would hesitate to answer or even offer to talk to someone else. There was always a clear form of communication.” Adrienne Harmon, Director of Marketing – The Father’s Table \n",

Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Apexon re-imagined the underlying data architecture of the claim processing platform. This included a scalable, cloud-based file system and data analytics solution built on Azure data lake and other storage services. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time a more efficient claim processing model Healthcare providers generate patient UB/EOB data consisting of hospital claims, remittance advice, EDI files (837, 835 format), clearing house data, payer contract documents, and more. These claims are provided to the payers (insurance/clearing houses/third party agents) that can send the claim back, deny payments, or approve partial claims of the provider. This process required provider analytics team members to review the UB/EOB claim data manually and come up with an analytical model(s) to calculate propensity score to find if the submitted claims were going to be denied, partially approved, or sent back with queries. The company want to provide its clients with a more efficient claim processing model. The idea was to  have a centralized  platform – a  provider data lake – that could  support claim processing for multiple clients in a multi-tenant environment. This solution had the potential to simplify healthcare benefit design, management and execution, and make the company a one-stop enterprise technology partner for the healthcare industry.

      "Medical Instrumentation Brand Leverages Digital To Recapture Market Share - Apexon  Medical Instrumentation Brand Leverages Digital To Recapture Market Share Success Story Healthcare Medical Instrumentation Brand Leverages Digital To Recapture Market Share Apexon helps increase customer outreach and sales with feature-rich B2B commerce platform Download With more than 15,000 products, this manufacturer offers one of the most comprehensive lines of diamond dental and surgical instrumentation with the goal of meeting the needs of any practice. Its direct-sales model allows it to provide the highest quality instrumentation at competitive prices. The company takes pride in its loyal customer base. In a blind survey of dental practitioners using diamond dental instruments, it was favored by a 2-to-1 margin over its closest competitor. The company was also rated the #1 diamond brand in innovation, precision, quality, and assortment. Despite its long-standing market leadership and loyal customer base, the company had fallen behind in its customer payment experience, specifically the payment options it offered. A lack of credit card payment gateways on its multi-site digital platform was increasing the outstanding credit and disrupting the B2B customer experience. So, the company partnered with Apexon to implement a B2B commerce store using the industry-leading B2B Commerce Cloud by Insite. Founded in 1976 A comprehensive line of dental and surgical instrumentation made in the USA Direct sales model the Results Key Outcomes Increased market share, brand loyalty, & advocacy Faster payment cycles as a result of reduced offline payment hassles & manual invoice handling Improved UI & CX across the organization for a streamlined customer journey Actionable insights through data analytics within the outstanding & credit structures The challenge A LACK OF CREDIT CARD PAYMENT GATEWAYS DISRUPTING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE When the company first decided to upgrade its B2B commerce experience, it started by implementing the Cenpos gateway. But this required a direct inflow through their websites into the AS Infor A+ system. And there wasn’t any invoice tracking available, leaving the economic records in disarray. There were other challenges as well: Key credit card checkout features such as saved selections, billing addresses and postal codes were lacking The absence of an invoice-wise structure meant no flexibility in partial payments Payment cycles were frequently uncoordinated as a result of excessive manual requirements The lack of a seamless ecommerce experience led to customer distrust and loss of market share The Solution B2B PAYMENT GATEWAY & BACKEND INTEGRATION CREATE A MORE CUSTOMER-CENTRIC EXPERIENCE The CX experts at Apexon took a two-step approach to bring the brand’s core functionalities at par with customer and market expectations. 1 Established a backend integration supplementing the Cenpos payment gateway to introduce credit facilities and rebuild the outstanding management system. These included: Integration with PCA predict for address lookup and validation; Avalara for tax calculations Integration with ERP Infor A+ for product catalog, pricing, customer, salesperson Integrations with ERP for Order and Invoice history Integration with PCA predict for address lookup and validation Integration with CENPOS for credit card payment Integration with Google Analytics/GTM 2 Developed comprehensive functionality to enhance and streamline the B2B customer experience, including: A unified view of the invoice history at a single dashboard A detailed Outstanding Invoices page reflecting real-time balances and pending invoices Single and multiple invoice selections with pre-populated credit card information A Pay Account Balance button for one-stop checkout window and saved credit cards All content and product information aligned with new features to maximize conversions A comprehensive credit system segregating outstanding lists and credits for one-to-one applications Best price logic for customers using contract pricing and global promotions Volume-based pricing rules Customizations to promotion engine to define new rule types Sales rep order placement on behalf of customers New user registration workflow New Daily Order and New User reports Apexon also recommended and implemented solutions to improve the site performance through use of caching and modification of static content. We also upgraded the site with the latest patch release for Insite Commerce 4.2 version. Outcomes The new B2B website was successfully launched in August 2017 and immediately contributed to the client recapturing lost market share and gaining new share. Some of the specific outcomes include: Increased market share, brand loyalty, and advocacy Increased customer outreach and sales through a modern, feature-rich B2B platform Faster payment cycles as a result of fewer offline payment hassles and reduced manual handling of invoices Improved UI and CX across the organization for a streamlined customer journey Actionable insights through data analytics within the outstanding and credit structures \n",

As a travel company with cross-continent operations, this client needed to revamp its web presence to reflect the current market realities of modern travel booking. Both its B2B and B2C websites had fallen behind in design, user engagement, and scalability. The company engaged with Apexon to re-think its approach with a focus on a modern customer experience, flexible architecture, and agile application development capability. Based in London, UK Over 100 years of experience across the globe Dedicated teams of regional and local experts the Results Key Outcomes A MODERN WEB EXPERIENCE WITH FEWER STEPS & FASTER BOOKING SCALABLE CMS FOR EASIER SITE MANAGEMENT WITHOUT IT SUPPORT REDUCED MAINTENANCE COSTS & REQUIREMENTS The challenge AN OUTDATED ONLINE PRESENCE UNABLE TO SUPPORT A GLOBAL NETWORK OF SUPPLIERS, AGENTS & TRAVELERS This client’s global travel business required a vast network of suppliers and agents to have simultaneous access to its catalog of travel offerings. It was also becoming increasingly dependent on a high level of personalization and optimized customer experience. In reality, the client was having a difficult time delivering on those expectations because of its outdated web presence. In addition to the overall look and feel: Its distributed CMS system was leading to frequent miscommunication in offers and promotions Search, booking, amendment and cancellation involved a lot of unnecessary clicks for users A poor payment system was leading to prospective bookings and revenue losses Product pricing and availability were continuously fluctuating with supplier data As the client looked at its next steps to address the situation, it also had to contend with the potential of any website migration leading to disruptions in travel package information. The Solution A COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL OF COMMERCE CAPABILITIES WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE BUSINESS Apexon worked with the client to modernize both its B2B and B2C commerce capabilities to meet the needs of its global network of suppliers. We started by implementing an interactive application with Angular 1.7 (SPA), Sitecore (CMS) and .Net as the back-end technology. This covered a built-in CMS, complete personalization and eCommerce capabilities for a comprehensive overhaul. From there, we went on to: Build and deploy an authorized CMS to display offers and promotions with no delay Use searched, booked and wish-listed products for customer-based UX and personalization Add support for all international cards, debit vouchers and partial payments Implement advanced Apache solr search, allowing keyword-based product search Ensure higher site speeds by creating a caching mechanism with Redis Cache Integrate supplier and middle-layered APIs for real-time pricing and availability Customize the migration utility for data transfer from third parties to the Sitecore structure Outcomes With Apexon, this multinational travel company has transformed the commerce and support experience for suppliers, agents and travelers.

      "Digital Printing Innovator Reimagines its Technology Infrastructure  Digital Printing Innovator Reimagines its Technology Infrastructure Success Story High Tech Digital Printing Innovator Reimagines its Technology Infrastructure Apexon accelerates transition to cloud-based, subscription business model Download SUMMARY Our client, a division of a giant European conglomerate, is an innovator in digital printing technology and workflow for large-scale, commercial applications. The company designs, develops and delivers web-fed digital color presses with built-in software-based workflow for high volume printing and packaging of labels, documents, newspapers and more. The company also OEM’s a variety of printing innovations for publishing and platemaking. The company’s flagship product, once a model of technical innovation, had started to create some challenges with customers. Its one-size fits all, on-premises deployment model conflicted with the increasing demand for more flexible, subscription-based solutions that could be easily updated and configured to meet unique customer needs. The client engaged Apexon in late 2019 to help modernize its software approach and the underlying technology infrastructure and architecture that supported it. The scope of the project encompassed the technical, business and user experience aspects of the solution including analytics to better understand and inform customer usage. Founded 1988 A leader in digital printing workflow Over 500 employees in the US and Europe the Results Key Outcomes Offshore delivery model delivers 3X the output at the same budget Modernized business model Increased customer satisfaction, loyalty Our Methodology REVEAL HOW WE DO IT Apexon works with companies across the digital lifecycle. Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Launch & Experiment: Enable digital adoption in a quick and agile manner. Apexon helped modernize client’s software approach and the underlying technology infrastructure and architecture that supported it. Be Digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Automate & Accelerate: Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale. Apexon designed a new dynamic workflow deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud architecture to create a scalable and modular architecture that was future- proof. Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Intelligent & Autonomous: Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time. Apexon also helped with the data analytics supported by machine learning to provide the client with a better understanding of customer usage and created new up-sell and cross-sell opportunities. The challenge Outdated Technical Infrastructure and Business Model The client’s printing machines were built for large, industrial scale applications – newspapers, labeling, documentation – and typically occupied an entire room or shop floor. But the client’s innovation was much more than the machinery. The company was an early leader in software-powered workflow printing that enabled users to incorporate complex configuration to customize large print runs. No other company could offer the same depth of functionality. Its landmark product had been developed in the early 2000’s at a time when enterprise software was deployed exclusively on-premise. As such, every time there was a software update or new feature release, it had to be shipped out to each customer and installed on-premise. Over the years, this has become more and more of an obstacle, creating a number of technical, business and user experience (UX) challenges for its customers. Technical Outdated technology infrastructure and architecture created scalability issues. On-premise installation created challenging release and maintenance processes. There was lots of customer pushback. Some refused to install updates. The client had no visibility into customer installation or usage. Business Cleint was unable to meet growing customer demand for more flexible product delivery. The lack of a subscription-based consumption model created dissatisfaction. Customers had to take all the updates or none. They could not pick just the ones they needed to install. There was no flexibility. The lack of analytics created blind spots regarding customer usage and product development. The client was unable to expand its offerings and create new revenue streams. UX The product had a complicated user interface that was originally developed on web forms. There were no dynamic workflows. The linear process created unnecessary complexity and extended cycle time. Poor role-based capabilities and views added further complexity. The delivery model made it difficult to expand and improve the feature base. It was clear to the client that they needed to re-think their approach. There was an urgent need to modernize on a cloud-based infrastructure to address the full breadth of technical, business and UX challenges. The client had originally planned a multi-year product roadmap, but it realized that approach would not meet its challenges quickly enough. The Solution A Future-Proof, Cloud-Based Subscription Business Model Apexon’s engagement is focused on addressing each of the technical, business and UX challenges described above. Technical Solution Apexon designed a new dynamic workflow deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud architecture. It includes a modernized UI using micro-services for maximum development flexibility, CI/CD pipeline, scripted environments, and cloud-native implementation. When fully completed, the architecture will also support both mobile and voice interfaces. Integration management will also be incorporated – including the client’s SAP, B2B Webshop, CRM and CDP systems. The goal is to create a scalable and modular architecture that is future proof. Business Solution The cloud-based architecture and microservices enable the client to offer its customers a more flexible subscription-based consumption model with flexible deployment options. Users deployed the functionality they needed, when they needed, via the cloud. The solution will also include subscription payment options when completed. Analytics supported by machine learning provide client with a better understanding of customer usage and create new up-sell and cross-sell opportunities. UX Solution An intuitive modern design with configurable UI/UX and workflows enable each customer to address its specific needs. Users can also drag and drop tasks to build dynamic workflows. Other capabilities being developed to elevate the UX include single sign-on, license management, libraries and usage management, asset management, user dashboards, approval workflows, and priority management. AWS Cloud Apexon developed a micro-services architecture based on .NET Core Web APIs to support web applications hosted on Amazon ECS cluster. The architecture leverages a number of AWS tools and services for optimal scaling, inter-service communication, serverless compute, authentication and authorization, infrastructure security, app logging and monitoring, and external configuration. Powered by Outcomes The client’s new cloud and micro-service driven architecture has enabled it to modernize its business model and position itself for the future. Dynamic workflows, easy feature enhancements Customer analytics Intuitive UX Scalability to ensure faster time to market Offshore resources delivering 3x the output at the same budget \n",

When Peloton initially launched in 2012 it was completely focused on development, with no QA resources in place. Peloton looked to Apexon for its expertise in Agile, test automation, and continuous integration to support its product development efforts and assure an exceptional user experience. New York-based exercise equipment and media company 3.1 million users and rapidly growing Produces stationary bikes that stream videos on a touchscreen built on top of Android Apexon worked with Peloton beginning in 2013 for over three years. Apexon was able to implement a Quality Engineering (QE) framework and solutions for testing all aspects of the tablet hardware and application involved in the Peloton offering. the Results Key Outcomes Reduced Regression Testing Time Even with approximately 50 regression test scenarios, testing time was cut from 4 hours to 1.5 hours. Automated Testing Using Selenium for Android, Apexon automated 80% of Peloton’s test footprint, clearing out a long backlog of test requirements to accelerate Peloton’s time to market. Ongoing Monitoring Application performance and functionality was continuously monitored by 10 screens running simultaneously. Faster Time-to-Market And greater control over operational costs. Our methodology how we did it With this company, Apexon worked across all stages of the digital lifecycle on multiple projects for two separate business units. Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Be digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Launch & Experiment Automate & Accelerate Be Intelligent & Autonomous Launch & Experiment Enable digital adoption in a quick and agile manner Apexon Quality Pod created a comprehensive QE testing framework and implemented a Shift-Left strategy for ongoing quality control.

Apexon set up an ongoing monitoring framework for Peloton, with 10 screens running at all times, to check application performance and functionality and to act as a source of data for continuous integration . The challenge A NEW fitness concept Peloton was founded in New York’s Silicon Alley in 2012 to create a new concept in fitness. The Peloton includes interactive team sessions streamed through a custom Android tablet. Sensors measure resistance of the bike and send that data to the tablet. Making the rides realistic required a virtual-reality-like answer, so that the video streaming on the bike’s tablet would correspond with the actions from the bike and vice-versa—all while designing social interactions to push and inspire the riders. This required a combination of completely new and existing technology working together seamlessly, and while Peloton put all its efforts into product development, it had no QE resources in place. The Solution Working as a team Apexon was able to provide QE for all aspects of the tablet hardware and application involved in the Peloton offering. When Apexon implemented the QE testing framework, 80% of Peloton’s test footprint was automated using Selenium for Android. In addition, regression testing time was cut by more than 50% – from 4 hours to 1.5 hours. Apexon helped Peloton get their mobile, digital, and IoT initiative to market faster, more efficiently and more flexibly while assuring an outstanding user experience.

Apexon integrated Bulley & Andrew’s new instance of Salesforce with its existing Procore project management software system. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time The challenge Centralizing data on a single platform Bulley & Andrews had been following a disciplined documentation process to record all customer interactions and essential data to each project. However, as the customer base and project volume grew, so too did the related information. Data resided on multiple platforms making it more difficult to manage and access. This created a number of difficult challenges: Disconnected communication Resulting from multiple spreadsheets, software platforms, and notes from in-person meetings. Lack of client interaction tracking Improper tracking methods made it difficult to effectively follow up on new leads and provide proper client support. Operational inefficiency Too much time was being spent by staff inputting data and creating repetitive communications across team members responsible for documenting project needs, leads, and sales. The Solution Implementing Salesforce Sales Cloud After assessing Bulley & Andrews’ situation and needs, Apexon recommended and deployed Salesforce Sales Cloud to help the firm increase its sales productivity and customer support. With Salesforce Sales Cloud, Apexon was able to integrate Bulley & Andrews’ current sales process seamlessly into the platform, allowing employees the simplicity and ease of creating their own accounts with related contacts and projects. It also enables team members to view information input by other team members creating a unified experience across the company.

Apexon also developed a data ingestion framework to work effectively on all unstructured data sources creating a unified data model. The challenge To build remote monitoring for patient vital statistics Personalized, predictive remote care is imperative to the future of healthcare. So, the promise of 24×7 remote monitoring of patient vital statistics was incredibly compelling to healthcare providers and others in the health ecosystem. But it also presented critical technology challenges for the company to ensure efficacy and performance. Some of these included: Developing a mobile application Building an engaging and intuitive companion mobile application to support both the patient and the care provider. The company did not have expertise in this area, but it was a critical aspect of the overall solution. Transmitting real-time data Doing this reliably on an ongoing basis between the sensors worn by the patients, the companion mobile application, and the cloud where the data was stored and accessed. This had to happen in the background so that it did not adversely impact the performance and battery usage of the sensors. De-identification of patient data Handling the de-identification of patient data as it is transmitted and stored to ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. Data framework Creating a framework for collecting patient and device data points to be used by the company’s data science team.

The Solution Focusing on 5 core areas As part of this engagement, Apexon focused on five core areas: A Companion Mobile App Apexon started with a small mobile application team developing the app on Android and iOS for use by both patients and care providers to view the patient’s health information. The team leveraged a low-energy BLE protocol for communicating data between the sensor worn by the patient and the mobile application which then was transmitted to the cloud. The Apexon team also integrated a health chat bot to monitor the health of patients. This enabled it to be used for the monitoring and contact tracing patients in Covid-19 quarantine scenarios. V&V and Production Support With a focus on quality at the core, Apexon started working on the development of an end-to-end QA strategy , system verification and validation, load testing and cloud performance testing . Apexon used its Quality Automation Framework (QAF) for automating API and performance testing to identify threshold factors and scalability of the company’s backend systems. The team is also identifying opportunities for optimization in support of Live customers and setting up early monitoring alerts to flag any potential issues with devices in use. Data Analytics, Data Science Apexon incorporated millions of patients’ data collected by the company to form the data foundation and expand the use of data science internally at the company. This involved developing a data ingestion framework which could work effectively on all unstructured data sources; creating a unified data model; de-identifying patient data; creating microservices API endpoints; and collecting performance data from all sensors and mobile devices including all alerts, crashes, hardware faults, watchdog resets, etc. Cloud & DevOps Apexon aligned the right resources and skills to develop Python API’s which were used to serve data to front-end mobile apps, device analytics, and device telemetry front ends. The team also used GCP Cloud Services such as DataFlow, PubSub, and Cloud Functions. Apexon also automated cloud monitoring using terraforms in the company’s staging and production environments. Bitbucket pipelines were used for infrastructure deployment. Pharma Partner SDK Apexon has also developed a partner SDK which enables the company’s Pharma partners to brand certain UI aspects of the solution and build branded applications around it for data presentation, alerts and more. \n",

The Apexon team assisted with creating technology frameworks and accelerators and mobilizing expert resources required for modernization. Ranked in the top 100 US Corporations by revenue $40B+ net worth of the company Award-winning mobile app – PRNewswire 36,000 employees across the US Apexon worked closely with the bank to build a closely governed data platform to implement its data strategy roadmap focusing on data modernization and regulatory compliance. The data migration was accelerated by redefining the bank’s semantic data layer, formulating data strategy, and establishing Information governance. Analytic data assets were designed, built, and a controlled platform was developed. the Customer Journey A three-year development roadmap was created to modernize the Bank’s data platform to address the needs of various personas, accelerate regulatory and compliance requirements, and scale to meet future demand. 2020 2021 2022 2020 Build frameworks, roadmap, and data strategy for data quality management, migration, and IT control 2021 Data modernization and migration, IT data controls, and data quality framework 2022 Legacy data and process migration to cloudtech stack, IT controls and governance on-premises data assets and users migrated to the Snowflake cloud on AWS The challenge getting ready for internal & external audits The bank must maintain the highest levels of transparency in regulation and compliance. This requires establishing the highest standards and controls to support proactive compliance. The bank needed to maintain data lineage, quality, and readiness for internal and external audits. The data assets that are governed well play a key role in providing periodic updates to the regulators. Bank had Legacy data assets and platforms that needed to be remediated along with modernization of data platforms and capabilities. The bank needed a robust 3-year roadmap that addresses all data needs with the correct dependencies and priorities. There is a need for democratization and clear ownership of data assets; concepts like data mesh go a long way in this regard. Banks need to invest in the right data architecture to support multiple personas within and outside the bank. All data sourced from the system of records, certify critical data elements, and quality measured end to end is vital for building the trust and accuracy of the analytical models. Platform health and total cost of ownership are critical for managing all data assets; banks need to define a clear strategy. Apexon Recommendations The Apexon consulting team recommended that the bank integrate a cloud-based data warehouse and data analytics solution built on AWS and Snowflake to ease the development of cloud applications needed for diversification along with a domain-based information consumption layer. Apexon collaborated with the internal engineering teams of the bank and developed its team PODs to deliver on this vision. The IT organization planned to develop a fully functional data platform and build data assets in the Snowflake data cloud environment. However, this required the company to migrate its legacy data to Snowflake with the least possible interruption to existing services. Quality resources with migration experience were needed to build data assets. However, the company did not have the resources experienced in Snowflake data migration. The bank was looking for a solution to ensure they met the audit and regulatory compliance requirements desired by the consent order. Apexon identified three areas of development that could provide the bank’s compliance. The bank needed a data quality framework that took care of flagging and reporting suspicious activities Due to the legacy system-imposed limitations, the organization wanted to move to the Snowflake cloud data platform to support its growth. However, it did not have the resources sufficiently trained in managing migrations It needed to establish stringent IT controls to address compliance needs To support the organization’s data strategy, Apexon worked closely with the bank to build common services and standards, configure, and mature a new tech stack, and complete operational metadata logging and evidence of controls. The project scope included migration of legacy assets to the cloud, data quality engine, development of control, operational metadata logging, and other data governance processes. The Solution SUPPORTING GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS The Apexon team began working with the bank in 2020. It supported three areas of improvement – Data Quality Framework, IT Control Framework, and Snowflake Data Migration – to support the governance requirements of the bank. DATA QUALITY FRAMEWORK Industry-standard data model, the user interface to define rules and process rules on batch and real-time data. The data quality framework was platform-agnostic and supported data quality governance across both on-premises and cloud platforms. The Data Quality Framework enabled the bank to meet data quality standards across dimensions as required by the governing bodies. For this: A platform agnostic data quality framework was developed to guide the automation of data quality rule execution based on the Information governance catalogue The framework provided the flexibility to run rules on all critical data elements and attributes to generate ownership reports The framework supported end to end data quality management across on-premises and cloud platforms to establish information governance and perform anomaly detection Apexon created drill-down dashboards for executives and data stalwarts to provide a comprehensive view of data health and deep dive into data quality issues A data quality core engine build with 48 data quality checks library, data quality jinja rule parser and evidence centralization IT CONTROL FRAMEWORK Operational control on routine tasks established and reusable components developed for the customized data model. To establish internal controls that could meet the minimum requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, an IT control framework was implemented. Apexon developed an IT Control Framework for tracking and reporting to meet the regulatory need for internal controls. This included: Analytical Data Assets Building a custom operational data model with reusable components Controlled Platform Development Built a flexible, self-service platform for its customers integrated with a metadata repository and data quality engine Cloud Application Development Addressing new and increasing customer requirements Reporting Through Dashboards Notifications, heatmaps, and their drill-downs are reported to senior executives, application owners, risk and compliance teams Compliance Monitoring Compliance monitoring engine reads from datastore to flag evidence from a centralized database as PASS or FAIL based on thresholds set by control owners and sends proactive alerts to users for possible failures The team executed DQ controls on 1600+ Delimited, Fixed Length and JSON files Data quality engine on Snowflake applied 326 critical data elements Migration of applications with OpenShift User Interface was developed for rile configuration SNOWFLAKE MIGRATION Legacy data migrated to Snowflake cloud with Lift, Improve, and Shift approach that improved data pipeline through restructuring. As the transformation partner of the Bank, Apexon also worked with the data engineering teams to lead data migration to Snowflakes. To support the transition of the bank from its legacy system to a modern data platform, Apexon managed the end-to-end migration to Snowflakes which included: Commitment to industry-standard information governance and regulatory compliance requirements Resource development and mobilization to support migration and new demands of the business Deployment of resources on Snowflake for legacy asset migration and SAS user migration Rapid transition from legacy-based systems using Hadoop, Netezza, DataStage, Mainframe, custom-built framework, control-m, DB2, Oracle, and external sources to the cloud Data Quality Engine and controls framework was installed on Streaming Data and ADS, and it provided data quality engine rule authoring ui, control evidencing, self service reporting, case management integration, and integration with reference data The aggregated impact of these developments helped the bank meet the regulatory needs of the consent order by addressing the issues of data quality and establishing proper IT controls. To help the company meet the compliance and regulatory requirement of the bank, a controlled data platform was built on Snowflake’s data cloud that allowed for easy scaling and real-time access to data. For these deliveries, 400 engineers from the bank were supported by 90 Engineers mobilized from Apexon resources in creating data models, establishing data governance, performing the migration, and developing applications for business growth. Fungible resource PODs were formed from the delivery team to meet the quality regulatory requirements and develop the Tech Stack of Snowflake, DBT, Kubernetes cluster, Kafka, and Control-m.

The challenge More Timely Data & Information to Enable Customer Self-Service Heniff’s sales and services team found itself spending a lot of time taking inbound calls on the same types of topics: From Customers Account information, shipment status, invoices, service requests, and information requests From Drivers Scheduling, activity/metrics related to safety and compensation (i.e., mileage, hours, trips), company updates, and key contacts Heniff wanted to make this information more readily available online to both groups to better meet their needs and reduce the unnecessary burden on staff. The company was already using Tableau reporting on a very limited basis and had decided to use Salesforce Experience Cloud to expose its existing Tableau dashboards, which contained a lot of the required information. But they did not have a clear path forward and knew they were only getting limited value out of their Tableau reporting capability. The Heniff team knew they could do more to support the business and enhance the experience, so they turned to Apexon — to help explore what was possible, to define a plan, and to execute on it. Apexon was selected based on its proven expertise in Salesforce Experience Cloud and Tableau and its value-added ability to expand Heniff’s thinking about how the online experience could be optimized for users. The solution Personalized Self-Service Information Access via Salesforce Experience Cloud Salesforce Experience Cloud lets users create branded digital experiences to share information and collaborate with key constituents such as customers, partners, and employees. Businesses can create multiple sites for different purposes and transition seamlessly between them. Companies use Experience Cloud to connect employees with distributors, resellers, and suppliers, providing answers to common inquiries in one convenient place, and highlighting important news and information. By making key information and connections more accessible, the Experience sites also improve the overall experience users have with the business. 1 Apexon helped Heniff map out a path forward to take advantage of the capabilities in Salesforce Experience Cloud and Tableau to meet its goals and prioritize those capabilities that would deliver the highest business value. This involved defining the information needs of the different users and laying out a plan for how to address those needs. 2 Once that roadmap was clearly defined, Apexon designed and developed custom Salesforce Experience sites with Tableau reporting embedded into integrated with Tableau for both customers and drivers. Customers view a Heniff branded website, while drivers view either a Heniff or carrier-branded website. 3 The implementation included single sign-on access to all the information they need. This greatly streamlines the user experience. Users have instant access to customer embedded Tableau reports using the permission functionality in Salesforce Experience Cloud. There are no decisions or configurations to worry about. Users see the information they need, when they need it. As a result of the success with the customer and driver experiences, Heniff has worked with Apexon to apply the same type of experience for employees – where they can access all HR policies, employee information, company news and more. Each group has different permissions based on roles, regions, and the different information they need access to.

The Challenge Streamlining Patient Burden Information Extraction with GenAI Solutions Our client, a leading healthcare data science company, faced significant challenges in extracting patient burden information from clinical trial documentation. This vital data, which details the time, scans, tests, and medications involved in a trial, was crucial for understanding the potential impact on participants. However, the existing process was manually performed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), consuming substantial time and labor resources. The manual nature of the process led to inefficiencies, potential errors, and higher operational costs, ultimately impacting the overall effectiveness of their clinical trials. Several key obstacles included: Inefficient GT Creation The manual extraction of patient burden information was a labour-intensive process that required SMEs to spend 7-8 hours per document analysing and preparing the Ground Truth (GT) from 46 sets of protocols. This reliance on manual input caused significant delays. Potential for Human Error The tedious nature of manually reading and analysing lengthy clinical trial documents increased the likelihood of errors, affecting the accuracy and reliability of the extracted information. Limited Scalability and Flexibility The existing process lacked the ability to quickly adapt to new patient burden variables, limiting the scalability and flexibility needed to efficiently manage evolving clinical trial requirements. Data Accuracy The manual processes did not support the high level of accuracy needed for reliable decision-making, potentially compromising the quality of the patient burden data. High Operational Costs The significant time and labor required for manual extraction increased operational costs, reducing overall efficiency and profitability. The Solution Automating Patient Burden Information Extraction for Ground Truth Creation with Cutting-Edge Technology Recognizing the limitations of manual extraction processes, Apexon developed an innovative solution to streamline the extraction of patient burden information, improve accuracy, and enhance efficiency. The goal was to make the extraction process faster, more accurate, and cost-effective by leveraging advanced AI technologies, significantly reducing manual intervention, and enhancing operational workflows.

      "AutoProtect Group Migrates to AWS to Drive More Efficient Infrastructure - Apexon  AutoProtect Group Migrates to AWS to Drive More Efficient Infrastructure Success Story Manufacturing AutoProtect Group Migrates to AWS to Drive More Efficient Infrastructure Apexon helps automotive insurer shift its operations into high gear in the cloud And More Download AutoProtect Group provides a suite of solutions to the automotive industry including insurance products and dealer warranties, F&I technology, compliance services and minor damage repairs. The company protects hundreds of thousands of drivers every year and holds an ‘Excellent’ rating on Trustpilot, from over 9000 verified reviews. Since 2018, the company has been part of two M&A activities, adding new insurance and service offerings, as well as advanced technology capabilities and a mobile vehicle repair network. AutoProtect Group creates customized business development programs designed to help its partners market their comprehensive offerings – from sales training to smooth integration and effective implementation with full FCA-compliance. Ongoing support is delivered by a seamlessly integrated web-based system called AutoProcess which includes incisive real-time reporting, so finance and insurance (F&I) performance can be easily measured and managed. Founded in 2004 Supporting hundreds of thousands of vehicle insurance customers MotorTrader Independent Dealer Award 2022 Insurance Times Tech & Innovation Award 2022 As the company has expanded, it has continually invested in its systems and processes to support its business needs and stay ahead of the competition. The goal was to reduce risk of operation by increasing technical ownership within the application development team and also reduce operational expenditure on hosting environments. Moving the co-located service onto cloud-based platforms gave an opportunity to address both. This led them to Apexon and its strong track record in cloud strategy and migration. the Results Key Outcomes Reduced Cost of Server Maintenance High Availability Cloud Services Enhanced Data & Infrastructure Security the challenge An outdated & inflexible technology infrastructure Despite its efforts, AutoProtect Group was investing substantial sums and efforts to manage and maintain its existing datacenter infrastructure which was a combination of on-premise installations, co-located data centres and minimal AWS Services supporting business critical functions and services. The entire infrastructure landscape was being maintained by a co-location provider at an estimated run-cost of approximately £25,000 per month exclusive of a projected capital investment soon to be required to refresh the hardware to ensure support and parts availability. Not only were operational support costs high, the infrastructure itself was very inflexible. Resources were oversubscribed and elasticity was poor. Any change in hardware or operating systems was tedious and costly. It created a vicious cycle. AutoProtect Group wanted to modernize, but could not afford the disruption to the business, creating a growing technical and operational gap. Apexon was engaged initially to help advise AutoProtect Group on its options and plot out a potential migration strategy. This “discovery” phase included an assessment of business applications to determine the migration requirements in terms of source code, platform compatibility, migration complexity, and cloud readiness. Apexon also collected and analyzed application-related data to provide recommendations for target environments, along with each application’s affinity to a cloud environment. There were different aspects which needed to be considered: AutoProtect Group wanted AWS Infrastructure primarily to leverage its cost and operational efficiencies An end-to-end AWS Infrastructure was considered as the interim goal till the changes to technical landscape could be made A “Lift & Shift” of the as-is implementation was required without re-factoring and addressing technical deficiencies. These limitations had to be understood and absorbed initially The transition to AWS had to be completed within a tight time limit, i.e., before AutoProtect Group’s annual data center agreement came up for renewal in a few months The Solution End-to-End AWS Cloud Infrastructure to Accelerate Business Operations As a result of its work during discovery, the Apexon team had a thorough understanding of the challenge AutoProtect Group faced migrating to a 100% AWS cloud infrastructure . Initial design and planning laid out a path forward and then Apexon provided detailed migration and cutover plans to help the AutoProtect Group team see exactly how its cost, management and uptime requirements could be met within its timeframe. The key steps in AutoProtect Group’s journey to AWS included the following: AWS Immersion Days AutoProtect Group’s migration journey with Apexon started with AWS Immersion Days for Security and Containerization. These immersion days allowed AutoProtect Group to upskill their staff in preparation for managing a future infrastructure state on AWS. After successful completion of the Immersion Days, AutoProtect Group were then positioned to begin project planning the migration of one of its core datacenters to AWS. “When considering migrating our workload to AWS we could see the myriad of benefits but needed to ensure that our path to realising them was addressing any risks effectively throughout. With Apexon we were able to effectively combat each of those risks. The AWS immersion days, for me, demonstrates the true power of working with a partner with the breadth of capability that Apexon have. For us, running infrastructure on AWS was only one piece of the puzzle, the more critical piece being ensuring that we have the capability to maintain and grow it once our services are there. The trainers rapidly upskilled our staff in key areas, like security and monitoring, to ensure once the project was completed we were best positioned to uphold our high standards for resiliency and security. This programme of work was not simply a lift and shift, but an entire paradigm shift in our company’s approach to managing IT resources, and Apexon have excelled in helping us with every stage of that journey.” Callum Smith Head Of Development AutoProtect Cloud Platform Selection Apexon conducted two weeks of Blueprinting with AutoProtect Group to understand the high-level requirements and challenges. This included gathering current datacenter costs and the proposed cost improvements based on transitioning its existing on-premise infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Apexon helped the customer select AWS as a cloud provider based on cloud architecture principles, cloud best practices, design considerations and Apexon’s own experience working with AWS. Discovery & Assessment – Requirements APAdmin was the major component in AutoProtect Group’s technology landscape along with Auto Process, IClaims, Agent Web, WebForms and Dev Express UI all supporting overall business operations and functions. Migration of all of the above to AWS would be required in the long term. There were several factors from the assessment which helped define the migration strategy. The best way to connect on-prem architecture to the cloud Securing network infrastructure for public-facing web applications Security and restrictions to the environment and application Authentication process The need for scalability or load balancing of infrastructure Prioritizing server migration based on their types In-transit and at-rest data encryption Logging and monitoring Firewall and other routing Mobilization The AWS account structure, landing zone architecture, VPC design, on-prem connectivity, and migration blueprint were designed and implemented during this phase. Migration Execution The migration waves were planned and executed based on application dependencies. No specific migration tool was used. This was a Blue-Green deployment. First, Apexon launched all the resources and configured the replica environment on AWS. Then detailed cut-over plan was prepared and discussed with all stakeholders for seamless production migration. Then it was executed by cloud experts and migration engineers from Apexon. Post Migration Operational readiness and ongoing support were key to a successful migration. The Apexon team provided all required Operations Guide documentation and the migration team provided interactive training sessions on Cloud Operations, different AWS Services used for applications, database and Terraform/Terragrunt (IAC). The Apexon migration team implemented automation on monitoring, backup, and scheduling start-stop of non-production instances to save cost. The team also implemented the required controls to ensure security posture and cost optimization. AWS SERVICES USED: Amazon EC2 Amazon RDS FSX for Windows Amazon Route 53 Amazon CloudWatch AWS CloudTrail AWS GuardDuty AWS Certificate Manager AWS KMS AWS Organisations ELB AWS SNS AWS Lambda Outcomes AutoProtect Group was able to migrate its infrastructure over to AWS without any disruption to its business or its customers. Specific outcomes include: Cost Optimization The cost of server maintenance was reduced substantially as the physical infrastructure no longer needed to be maintained. Operational run-rate has reduced by 50% for just one of the core services, with further savings across other areas High Availability Cloud-enabled high availability of servers Enhanced Security Data and infrastructure protection mechanisms like security group, identity and access management, network access control, and CloudTrail enhanced security posture Disaster Recovery Provision Disaster recovery set-up for some servers \n",

      "Leading US Bank Accelerates Their Path to Digital Banking - Apexon  Leading US Bank Accelerates Their Path to Digital Banking Success Story Financial Services Leading US Bank Accelerates Their Path to Digital Banking Apexon improves the customer experience by modernizing banking software architecture and UI Download This US bank was looking to implement a large and complex UI platform that would be used to monitor and perform actions on payments as they flowed through the bank’s systems. Getting the architecture right at the start of a project was essential. It would save a lot of pain for both the bank as well as future developers who would inherit that work. Apexon was engaged to implement a custom solution that simplified the maintenance and use of the system with a streamlined architecture and more intuitive UI . Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in all major financial centres around the world 2nd on the list of investment banks in the world by revenue Ranked 59th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue the Results Key Outcomes More Flexible Architecture Faster Software Update Cycles Better, More Consistent Online User Experience Our methodology how we did it Apexon works with companies across the digital lifecycle. Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Be digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Launch & Experiment Automate & Accelerate Be Intelligent & Autonomous Launch & Experiment Enable digital adoption in a quick, and agile manner Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Apexon helped implement a custom solution that simplified the maintenance and use of the system with a streamlined architecture and more intuitive UI. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time The challenge Creating a “one stop shop” for the bank’s users End-users had to navigate an excessive amount of legacy UI tools that didn’t offer a consistent look and feel. To fix this, the bank needed a new architecture to support the system. It would save a lot of trouble for both the bank as well as future developers who would inherit that work. The bank’s developers did not want a software application where the user interface and data access code were merged into a single program from a single platform. That would require separate teams coordinating unnecessarily. It also wanted to avoid creating a large codebase that would quickly become difficult to understand and maintain as it grew. With this in mind, Apexon worked with the bank to define three core requirements for the solution: User-friendly Enable quick and easy navigation via one consistent (web-based) app Dev-friendly Separate release cycles for functionally discrete parts of the app Robust Functionally discrete parts of the app must be available to end-users if other parts, or the platform as a whole, go down These same requirements applied to the complex frontend app that would need to be built as well. The Solution Streamlined Architecture & More Intuitive UI Apexon was engaged to implement a custom solution that simplified the maintenance and use of the system with a streamlined architecture and more intuitive UI. The solution incorporated several key elements: Micro Frontend This design approach is highly recommended for legacy systems that are becoming difficult to maintain. Each element of the UI (a micro frontend) is served as a separate component. Those components are then bundled together in one overall UI (a shell/wrapper). Web Components Each micro frontend is defined as an HTML custom element making it easy to embed any Angular or React component into the shell. These web components easily communicate with other components and the shell and support browser navigation (in the way other single-page application routing works). They also support deep-linking and URL sharing. iFrames iFrames provide a backup to web components and allowed the embedding of a standard HTML document (the micro frontend) inside another HTML document (the shell). Apexon’s solution approach provided the bank with several key advantages: Protection against software regressions The insulated nature of the micro frontend pattern means as new components are added existing components are protected against software regressions. Accelerated software update cycles The micro frontend approach enables Web components to be updated separately. This allows for a breakdown of large changes, such as major upgrades to framework versions, into smaller tasks. Centralized UI data The web component approach, along with iFrames, allows firm-wide components to be embedded into a newly designed “one stop shop” UI. Apexon was able to provide one consistent UI without compromising on code maintainability and the product’s resiliency. \n",

Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time Apexon helped convert different data into a single format and transferred into a multi-cluster database. The data can be pushed to consumers and data analytics, or used for predicting trends and gaining customer insights. The challenge Provide a flexible solution tailored to each customer The company had been storing all project data on an internal system, requiring clients to reach out to the company anytime they needed to access something. The Senior V.P. of IT wanted to find a way to centralize and improve this process, as well as give clients easy access to the their project data. But they had a few major obstacles to overcome. Vendor Lock-in The solutions they were considering would lock them into a single provider, making the process more difficult and less liable for the customer. High Costs Each of the solutions had high license fees. The client wanted the flexibility of paying based purely on usage. The Solution Implementing a top-of-the-line cloud data warehouse: Snowflake Infostretch’s team of Snowflake experts started by cleansing and preparing the existing client data for integration. Snowflake allows both structured and semi-structured data to be easily moved into a centralized system, accessible to any user, on any application. The integration ensured that there was no limit on the amount of users and no maximum capacity for simultaneous users. Apexon also ensured that there would be no performance degradation in either scenario. Afterwards, the data could also be used for forecasting, analytics, and additional business insights. Apexon had experience and relationships with all of the solutions being considered, as well as others. One in particular seemed best suited to address the company’s need for flexibility, access, and customization: Snowflake. Different data is converted into a single format and transferred into a multi-cluster database. The data can be pushed to consumers and data analytics, or used for predicting trends and gaining customer insights. With Snowflake in place, the company is seeing big benefits: 200X faster system performance Once the integration was completed, the company saw a significant increase in performance both internally and externally 90% cost reduction Compared to other cloud warehouse databases that charge flat licensing fees.

      "US Bank: One-Stop Shop for CDs  Us-based Bank Becomes One-stop-shop For Cds Success Story Financial Services Us-based Bank Becomes One-stop-shop For Cds Apexon developed a unique digital platform to serve all CD information needs Download This institution has offered banking and financial services to individuals and corporate clients in the U.S. for over two decades. The U.S.-based bank focuses on digitally driven community banking services. It is one of the few banks in the U.S. with a cloud-based open Application Programming Interfaces (API) core banking system. Leveraging its human-first digital approach, Apexon created a platform to connect banks that offer CDs with the community of CD users by developing a responsive one-stop centralized application that serves all their CD-related needs. While it gave individuals an opportunity to select the right CD after comparing CD details of more than 1,000 banks, the client bank could create a competitive positioning in the community for its services. Apexon has been instrumental in helping the organization enhance the digital experience of its loyal customers while also helping the bank expand its reach and enhance its brand value. Over 20-year-old FDIC-certified bank One of the largest banks in the Northwest U.S. Over $750 million in assets The customer journey Discovery and Design(4 Weeks) Legacy application and user experience reviewed to discover gaps for improvement. Separate personas created subscribers, financial institutions, and administrators to address their unique needs Web Application Development (8 Weeks) A centralized web application developed to serve as a single destination for all information related to CDs Mobile Application Development (6 Weeks) Android and iOS applications developed for fast and easy access to CD information and recommendations Integrations (4 Weeks) Bauer rating integration reviews of 8,000 banks providing CDs in the U.S. User Acceptance Testing (4 Weeks) Collaborated with the product manager and business users to test and refine the CD Valet application the Results Key Outcomes Created a one-stop destination for users to access CD offers and rates across 30+ states, 1,000+ banks, and CD offers of 10,000+ (continuously growing with more banks being onboarded) Attracted huge subscriber base, opening opportunities to upsell and cross-sell banking and financial services Attracted 10k+ users during the first few weeks of launch Growing month on month, reached 40k+ in 3 months The challenge ENHANCE THE USER EXPERIENCE ACROSS MULTIPLE PERSONAS Certificates of Deposits (CDs) are popular in the U.S. market. They are safe, yield higher interest rates, and provide long-term stability. However, there are a wide variety of CDs available in the market from which subscribers can choose based on their individual needs and circumstances. It can all be overwhelming for customers, slowing the process and inhibiting CD deposits. The bank saw an opportunity to address a big market need by helping its customers more easily understand and find the right CDs to support their personal financial goals. For this, it developed and launched a pilot web application that allowed users to access all information related to CDs in the U.S. and perform interest rate calculations. The initial pilot was limited to “family and friends,” a close community of bank employees, relatives, and associates. Pilot users found the application useful in terms of understanding and finding CDs, but there were consistent concerns about its performance and user-friendliness. Feedback centered on the application’s poor look and feel. The UX also seemed to conflict with the latest industry best practices. Pilot users also cited limited comparison data and busy advertisements, which confused the user interface. Specific comments included: Poor functionality, difficulty comparing CD rates of return, and an unresponsive UI Limited filtering which made it difficult to choose different types of institutions Unresponsive rates pages The need for users to adjust their view settings anytime they changed devices Poor use of color and design The need for time-consuming manual data entry A limited number of banks overall, and a particular lack of local banks Poor functionality in key features such as the interest calculator and CD rate comparison The pilot application was also missing key functionality such as term options, market rate comparisons, and bank ratings. Moreover, the application was only sometimes updated with the latest CDs as it did not effectively account for the needs of institutional users updating CD information. The bank approached Apexon based on its extensive banking experience and strong reputation in user experience design. It also needed a technology services partner that could manage the complexities in application development . The bank needed to find a way to keep the applications updated on the latest interest rates and wanted to add more functionality for admin and financial institution users. The aim was to develop a one-stop destination to meet all the information needs of prospective CD customers. The Solution A ONE-STOP, DIGITAL DESTINATION FOR CD SHOPPING Apexon worked with the client to address the shortcomings in the CD application and ready it for production release. The approach was to create a web and mobile-based CD platform application (Android and iOS). Apexon’s engagement involved functionality for different user personas along with the data integration and technology stack to support it. PROCESS – Apexon used Agile methodology for application development with SCRUM to guide the team structure and iterations as teams worked in sprints. Multiple User Personas Apexon identified three major user personas – subscribers, financial institutions, and client-bank administrators – and developed specific functionality and features for each: For Subscribers: Display of CD information from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions including APY, rating, terms, and min/max balances The ability to save information related to subscribed CDs and calculate earnings and interest rates Submission of CDs not found on the application to be approved or rejected for addition to the platform by a client-bank administrator New filters to narrow search queries for specific banks, terms, APY ranges, and investment amounts User CD portfolios and watchlists Optional push notifications such as CD Portfolio alerts, CD maturity, and CD rate alerts for a specific APY range and term A break-fee calculator to helps users determine if/when to break existing CDs and enroll in new ones that will be more profitable Segregation of CD information by state or internet only For financial institutions, the CD valet application provided functionalities to: Allow users from the financial institutions to: Add CD rates to the CDs listed in the application Add new CDs that are not already listed on the application Highlight promotions and special rates Populate CDs from over 50 U.S. financial institutions and continues to automatically add data monthly For administrators (client-bank employees), the application provided features to: Access and validate the information submitted by financial institutions and approve if they are found correct Manage application configuration settings, users, and subscribers Leverage Agile development model to develop new features in multiple iterations Data Integration Apexon also developed a crawler program to scrape CD interest rate data from 20 bank websites and update them in the application automatically so that subscribers had an accurate view. The Apexon team also integrated the CD application with Bauer financials, an entity that provides ratings and reviews of banks, credit unions, and financial institutions trusted by users in the U.S. These ratings and reviews are pulled from banking portals through XML and displayed with respective CD listings on the application for the users to view. Technology Stack Apexon used the latest platforms and tools to power the CD valet application with the following components: Azure as the cloud service provider Cosmo DB from Azure for database NodeJS with expressJS for managing backend services ReactJS and NextJS for managing frontend services of the web portal React native to manage front-end for mobile applications A pre-built API is used for configuring and managing APIs centrally. The configurator provides functionalities like API retry mechanism, refresh token mechanism, and API mapping for managing multiple backends. Third party integration on the portal was managed with NodeJS for web scrapping provision of CD data for 50+ banks. For URL based integration and API based integration, KASASA and EMMA features were used. Results Apexon helped the bank leapfrog its competition by creating a one-stop destination for users to access current CD offers and rates from thousands of banks across the U.S. As a result, it now attracts a huge new subscriber base, opening profitable opportunities for upselling and cross-selling its banking and financial services while enhancing its brand value. \n",

      "Global Automotive Technology Provider Accelerates Digital Transformation  Global Automotive Technology Provider Accelerates Digital Transformation Success Story Manufacturing Global Automotive Technology Provider Accelerates Digital Transformation Apexon enhances organizational agility and collaboration Download This global supplier of technology and services offers end-to-end engineering, IT, and business solutions to the automotive manufacturing industry. As a part of its digital transformation journey, the company, has initiated numerous automation and computer vision projects designed to enhance process efficiencies in multiple areas of its business, including HR, Finance, and Operations. The company needed a large-scale migration from its legacy data management systems to new collaborative cloud storage, emails, and reporting models to support these efforts. Apexon assisted the client’s digital journey for over seven years and is still working as a strategic engineering partner. While the overall journey brought many changes to the organization, the individual components Apexon worked on helped the client overcome specific challenges and produced significant tangible results. Global supplier of technology & services to automotive manufacturers 20,000+ employees across the globe Over $1 billion in annual revenues The customer journey 2010-2015-2016-2019 SharePoint Migration Five versions from multiple regions across the globe merged into one window for a single moment of truth 2018 2019 2021 2022 2022 2018 Computer Vision Over 240 resources were deployed to manage 25+ processes and 7 types of computer visions 2019 Intelligent Automation Internal ad-doc work requirements are delegated to bots that reduce human efforts and enhance accuracy 2021 Architecture Design & Reporting Our high-performance architects sped up reporting by designing architecture and developing highly accurate company-wide dynamic reports 2022 MS Mail Migration Our high-performance engineers support customers executing migrations via the FastTrack Migration Hub from on-premises to the cloud with 24x7x365 support services 2022 Embedded Systems Co-developing Firmware services with the client, from the driver layer to the application layer, to manage devices and certifications the Results Key Outcomes More effective project collaboration across the organization Increased business agility & efficiency Accelerated development cycle time using automation Faster, more effective employee onboarding Improved financial reporting TRANSFORMATION ENABLED WITH MANAGED SERVICES FROM DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT Apexon has worked with the client on five different digital initiatives. The challenges and solutions for each initiative are outlined below: SHAREPOINT MIGRATION Traditional storage models lack filtering and collaboration capabilities, which is why the client company leverages Microsoft SharePoint. Its easy-to-use functionality and robust server architecture made it a good fit for the organization. This enabled effective collaboration between its global workforce of 20,000+ to deliver innovative solutions to its customers worldwide. The challenge Complexity & Version Sprawl SharePoint can be found in companies of all sizes. The platform is used differently from company to company, and its extreme adaptability means that it can deliver a web-based experience in almost any environment. This flexibility was both a benefit and a challenge for this global company. To enable collaboration across its 20,000+ employee organization, this company ran 700+ SharePoint farms globally, with multiple versions (2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, Online) in different regions, time zones, and business functions. This complexity impeded collaboration. Separate development teams worked on different versions of SharePoint, and 24/7 global support was required to cater to the needs of each region. Last but by no means least, the act of migrating the various versions for its distributed workforce added another layer of complexity to the overall process – a scenario that required specific expertise for not only each SharePoint version but also ownership for each defined business function. The Solution SharePoint Consolidation Enables Streamlined Delivery & Support Apexon’s team of digital experts was asked to look at the overall picture and propose a solution that met two core objectives: Aggregate the skills required to navigate SharePoint’s complexity successfully Provide a model for continuous delivery and support of SharePoint within the organization This required establishing different teams for Migration, Upgrades, and Developments while consolidating the available versions of the platform into one coherent whole. For this project, it was decided that SharePoint 2019 was the optimal path. This version had been designed to work both on-premises and in the cloud, with end users getting unified access to a host of next generation server features and functionality. Additionally, Apexon’s experts suggested adding new technologies and features, including Power Apps and Power Automate. To support the client’s 700+ SharePoint farms globally, Apexon deployed remote monitoring of farm health using Powershell scripts, AppDynamics, and NETIQ. Apexon also introduced a 24/7 global support model. By leveraging its digital expertise and taking a managed services approach for the client, Apexon was instrumental in helping the organization streamline its global operations and increasing its agility and efficiency using SharePoint. The consolidated version of SharePoint 2019 brought several key business outcomes: The consolidation of five versions of SharePoint into one– 2019 High availability and server farm load balancing Increased employee collaboration and technical innovation The ability to quickly ramp up internal teams for new projects Focused migration and development teams to support multiple versions of SharePoint – migrated to a single version Reduced SharePoint FTE requirements with Apexon Managed Monitoring services Streamlined global support covering all regions, time zones, business units, end users, and services. A single support window was established for change control and deployment COMPUTER VISION FOR AUTOMOBILES Apexon has been managing Computer Vision for automobile solutions for clients since 2017. It started with textured labeling and 25 resources and has since expanded to endpoint security, with 240 resources by 2022. The challenge Overwhelming Workload & Gaps in Computer Vision Expertise The client was on the path to creating a technological revolution with an autonomous system supporting self-driving cars. To develop intelligence in the vehicle, a video labeling system was needed to create awareness of the surroundings and self-determination of responses. However, launching a self-driving car takes a lot of development efforts and resources. A dedicated and experienced team was needed to build this intelligence to set up computer vision and managevideo labeling. A team must label various objects to train their application to ensure safe autonomous driving. The company was pressed with a short timeline in which the resources were to be hired, and video labeling was to be done while maintaining the highest quality. The Solution Automated Computer Vision Apexon created and managed multiple types of video labels using computer vision on videos that included: Bounding boxes to outline images of pedestrians, vehicles, lights, signs, and plates Polyline annotation to detect lanes and road markings Semantic segmentation of image pixels to separate objects from each other Near-range camera system to provide visibility of surroundings, including pedestrians and traffic lights LiDAR labeling to identify 3D cuboidal objects for interactivity With Apexon taking over the operational tasks of computer vision, the client saw important productivity gains: Over 250 million labels delivered since 2015 25+ sub-processes mapped with more than 99% accuracy on label quality 240 Apexon resources deployed with 190+ FTE involved in projects, creating big savings in time and effort for the client INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION The company’s new employee onboarding process was highly manual, time-consuming, and error-prone when assigning them to connected communities. Apexon simplified the process with bots that automated the categorization and assignment of new joiners to respective work communities. The challenge Slow Employee Onboarding that Hampered Productivity New employee onboarding is tricky, especially when the changes happen continually vs. in fixed batches. Putting together a workforce to assign new joiners to the right communities to create connected teams was an exercise diligently followed by the client. However, manual assignments invited errors in detailing and categorizing. The process was also very time-consuming. The Solution Intelligent Automation with Smart Bots Apexon developed a bot to oversee internal tools and reduce inefficiencies in categorization, notifications, measurement and reporting. Ad-hoc requirements like adding new members to communities, closing old notifications, and highlighting performance issues with different tools and systems were managed by bots. When Apexon trained a bot to take over the exercise, the manual work was almost eliminated. The bot could quickly pick the information about the employee and assign one to the right community in much less time. Some specific results included: Reduced processing time for assigning employees to respective work communities Eliminated 90% of required human efforts by taking care of notifications, performance measurement, and error identification 95% data accuracy with the identification and reporting of interface errors and systems issues Performance measurement of web-based tools to ensure that internal resources did not face data processing challenges in managing projects 30% cost savings through proactive identification of errors DATA ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPMENT FOR REPORTING The client needed a comprehensive view of the finances with data pulled from multiple applications to help company directors assess organizational performance with the least effort. Apexon designed the database architecture, user interface, program, and documentation with assured quality and high accuracy. As a part of the digital transformation, the client needed to migrate from its traditional mail service to MS fast while ensuring accuracy and security. The challenge Disparate Reporting/Analytics The client needed to create a report using data from multiple applications to provide a companywide view of finance with high data accuracy and quality documentation. The Solution Data Architecture to Enable Single View & Company-Wide Oversight Apexon engineers helped the client re-design reporting architecture and developed companywide financial reports for decision-makers. The report pulled data from multiple applications to present a comprehensive and interactive report for company-wide oversight.

The Solution Amazon Web Services (AWS) & Apexon Westhill needed a cost-effective technology platform capable of rapid analysis, computing, and deployment of new business features to support its business model and growth potential. To better understand Westhill’s specific requirements, Apexon conducted a two-week assessment covering business services to be automated, technical controls required to support business goals, risks and mitigation strategies , and security in the cloud. The additional analysis included cloud vendor evaluation, scalability, security, performance, cost, reliability, operational efficiency, and more. This included analyzing web traffic frequency-pattern-volume, type of services (homeowner, carrier, vendor), and specific security requirements of Westhill (infrastructure, data, and processes). As a result of its assessment, Apexon proposed to build a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda. With over 10+ services, Westhill paid only for the execution time of the Lambda functions. In addition, Lambda enabled developers to choose the programming language, further accelerating the delivery timeline and addressing skill gaps in the delivery team. This pay-only-for-execution time model helped Westhill save on compute cost, and handled peaks and valleys of web traffic very efficiently. The company was already using AWS Lambda serverless computing for a rules-based recommendation engine and workflow triggering tasks. This trigger-code-when-required approach helped them serve individual policyholders efficiently, capture logs, and trigger workflows using a step function – all of which were seen as a breakthrough in meeting their current design challenges in a cost-effective manner. Apexon also deployed AWS DynamoDB to store several gigabytes of homeowner insurance data with key-value pair. This provided high durability and large-scale performance with the ability to deliver within a few milliseconds. Other components of the solution built and deployed on the AWS Platform included: Rules-based recommendation engine Workflow mechanism to guide policyholder Escalation and feedback module Pricing and negotiation module Rapid compute process to serve customers quicker Rapid deployment model to meet mission critical and business critical tasks Key successes One of the key success factors in the engagement was the ability to quickly onboard Westhill’s system landscape on the AWS cloud, enabling important cost-saving controls and an efficient operational model to support multi-regional growth. Some of the key tenets of cloud architecture include: Secured client accessibility layer Enabled mobile and web client interaction with the AWS Cloud environment using secured https protocol and authentication mechanism using AWS Cognito service. Scalable service layer Handled several hundred client API requests with the help of AWS API Gateway while also improving customer engagement ratio and retention rates. Protected Database Layer To store data using flexible schema, structure, and data protection using encryption algorithms while meeting the reporting/ analytical needs of the user community. Monitoring, Logging & Notification Functionality Enabling monitoring to check overall health of the cloud resources, logging for user actions and notification mechanism. our approach In the deployment, Apexon followed AWS best practices and well-architected design guidelines by using the following AWS cloud resources: Cost AWS Lambda-based services as opposed to Dedicated EC2 instance and clusters Operational Efficiency AWS Lambda serverless architecture Performance AWS DynamoDB, Lambda, S3 storage Scalability AWS DynamoDB to store and process large size insurance dataset Reliability AWS Lambda serverless architecture Westhill now uses AWS for high-performance computing, workflow management, and risk analysis of customer data to create test and development environments for their commercial application SERVICES USED: Amazon API Gateway Amazon Cognito Amazon DynamoDB AWS Lambda Amazon SNS, S3 Amazon CloudWatch & IAM Apexon also deployed several 3rd party applications in support of the engagement, including: An application used by insurance carriers and other professionals to create/edit/submit insurance claims. These claim transactions were then pushed to the Westhill AWS platform for processing and reporting. A financial application used primarily to generate invoices, and process payments and settlement. This application is used by insurance carriers and other professional businesses to send requests for estimates and services to adjusters, contractors, and service providers. LESSONS LEARNED A Process of Continuous Improvement The Westhill engagement created several key learning opportunities for Apexon on AWS: Enable cloud resources in appropriate environments on an on-demand basis; e.g, services such as SNS and SQS can only be turned on in the QA and production environment since these services are not heavily used outside of development, Sandbox and other environments. This can offer important costs saving in the long run. Use of Lambda serverless architecture instead of EC2 created significant cost savings. Understanding business requirements, functions, and overall frequency of web traffic is important to ideate and optimize the solution for compute resources and related services. Westhill had a specific ask to design a solution to save cost when there is no web traffic or pay only when traffic is served. In this scenario, running and maintaining dedicated or reserved large EC2 instances would have created unnecessary expenses. Performing TCO cost assessment at the beginning of the project is a critical step to help management decide on budget allocation, cost optimization strategies, and to promote cloud resources as needed in a smarter fashion. the Results Key Outcomes Westhill gained significant business and technical advantages as a result of the deployment. Near 100% Customer Satisfaction Via fast deployment of new business models; process transparency 100% Business Continuity Assuring higher service levels and reducing operational costs Shift from CapEx to OpEx Model Enabling faster delivery of new, market-driven business features \n",

      "Transforming Home-Building Process for American Classic Homes - Apexon  Transforming the Home-Building Process for American Classic Homes Success Story High Tech Transforming the Home-Building Process for American Classic Homes Salesforce solution provides a unified application in the cloud to enable easy information access and optimize workflow Download American Classic Homes (ACH) is a privately-held wholesale builder in Jacksonville, Florida,   that focuses on making the home-buying experience as simple as possible for their investors, contractors, vendors and employees. ACH was looking to optimize the home building business process and introduce cutting-edge features to improve the customer experience. Central to this was giving visibility into the entire build process for employees, vendors and contractors. Local, privately-held wholesale builder Builds 600-1000 homes per year Most properties built for private real estate investors Employees selling and scheduling new home builds needed an automated way to configure, price and quote each build and an intelligent solution for scheduling the hundreds of tasks contractors had to complete to make a home move-in ready. ACH engaged with Apexon to help it leverage the cloud to connect the different players in its homebuilding process —  employees, vendors, and contractors. Apexon analyzed ACH’s business operations and recommended a Salesforce-based solution that centralized information in the cloud for easy real-time access and collaboration. the Results Key Outcomes Automated & Optimized Home Building Process Cloud Access From Anywhere, Any Device Centralized Application Our methodology how we did it Apexon works with companies across the digital lifecycle.

Automated configuration  to make design decisions and finalize the build configuration and pricing. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time Portal built on Salesforce Experience Cloud to provide vendors and contractors real-time information about all the work they’re doing for ACH. The Challenge Providing a clear understanding of responsibilities and timing Prior to working with Apexon, American Classic Homes couldn’t see the details of their build pipeline in one place and couldn’t provide its vendors, contractors or employees with precise, up-to-date information. This made it very difficult to access project data. Much of the essential build information was only available in hard copy format, making it difficult to track status of permit data, designs and other build-related paperwork.  This slowed communications and project progress significantly. The Solution Streamline the entire business process Apexon enabled processes on Sales Cloud, CPQ, Arrow PSA and QuickBooks to give everyone – inside  and outside of ACH – a clear understanding of the build,  all scheduled work, and project interdependencies. Apexon analyzed, documented and suggested changes to optimize the ACH build process from end to end and delivered the project using deep-dive process & requirements workshops followed by a series of design-build-test agile sprints. Vendors now receive purchase orders for materials and labor, driven by optimized pricing and margin features to help ACH pick the best vendor for each line item on the build schedule. Key results included: Automated and Optimized Home Building Process ACH is now able to make design decisions and finalize build configuration and pricing in an automated way using Salesforce CPQ. Vendors and contractors get real-time information about all the work they’re doing for ACH through a portal built on experience cloud. Cloud Access from Anywhere The Salesforce solution enabled ACH to push their entire home building process into the cloud for access anywhere, on any device with an internet connection. This streamlined communication, sped decision making, and prevented project errors. Centralized application The solution established a more centralized, robust and efficient business process for all. “Apexon is more than capable of helping any client meet the challenging demands of their industry. The team went above and beyond to ensure our complex needs were met, and in most instances exceeded our expectations.” Richard Briggs, ACH President \n",

Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale The open-source automation framework enabled the company’s delivery team to write automated UI tests for each interface. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time Using Apexon’s testing framework, automation scripts are executed on real mobile devices that can also be shared across different teams and different geographies for testing. The challenge To build a seamless, omni-channel experience The bank envisioned a seamless, omni-channel consumer-oriented experience that would differentiate its services from the competition and strengthen its customer relationships. This included enabling easy online account management (for example, adding payment accounts, enrolling in auto pay, making payments, requesting a quote, and much more). Behind the scenes though, the web and mobile applications had different frontend, backend, and database environments. Each channel presented a different experience. Addressing these problems was hampered by too many time-consuming manual QE processes including: Test cases It took a full week to execute. 100 test cases in a single environment Testing Cycles There was no ability to deploy tests on multiple environments at the same time, creating much slower testing cycles Testing expertise The bank also did not have any expertise testing large cases on multiple browsers, or testing hybrid test scenarios Slow cycle times Complex narrative testing scenarios slowed cycle time even further The Solution automation Framework The bank turned to Apexon to roll out a new technology architecture to facilitate the backend system upgrade along with new UI flows to provide a better customer experience . Apexon started by proving out test automation’s ability to deliver the speed, scale and efficiency required. Then it kicked off a well-defined test automation initiative that would serve as a model to accelerate the bank’s broader digital engineering efforts. The open-source automation framework enabled the company’s delivery team to write automated UI tests to simulate real user activities for each interface without worrying about common tasks across all of them. The tests were configured through standard testing configuration files, test run filters, and behavior was able to be changed within the config file. The automation framework also integrated with Perfecto’s cloud-based testing platform where test automation could be executed against real mobile devices and a variety of desktop web browsers in a secure private cloud. Using the framework, automation scripts were executed on real mobile devices on different versions of iOS and Android. The devices could also be shared across different teams and different geographies for testing. As a result, the bank was able to cut testing cycle time from one week and six manual resources to just four hours in a single test environment for 450+ test cases. It also increased capacity and efficiencies significantly. The company is now using this framework as a model to expand its use of automation and speed delivery cycles in other areas of its business. KEY AREAS OF PROJECT SCOPE INCLUDE: Jenkins for Continuous Integration Selenium grid for parallel execution Execution of hybrid scenarios using a single tool An open-source automation framework powered by SOAP web services Multiple batch scenarios which could be executed simultaneously \n",

Reporting systems were unable to meet the growing needs of the business, limiting visibility into performance, hampering decision making, and making collaboration between different functions and business units more difficult. This insurance company was looking for a data visualization solution designed to scale alongside the company’s rapid expansion. The company engaged Apexon to work with its C-level executives and marketing leads to understand its reporting needs and deliver a custom solution that could meet its diverse needs and growth with it.

It had more than 200,000 agents in 60 agency offices and over 35 independent partner offices. The company’s operations were spread across various branches and affiliates, making it difficult for executives to get a complete picture of the business. Without a standardized system, executives had to tediously sort through data in numerous layouts, formats, and files to draw conclusions. This created several big business obstacles: Dispersed Data Processes Disparate systems caused unorganized data and loosely defined data processes Decreased Productivity Across the Business The need to manually sort and validate data created time inefficiencies for executives and slowed important decision-making More Difficult Collaboration the lack of centralized reporting made it more difficult for different units and functions to coordinate and support one another’s goals The Solution Data Visualization & Engineering Apexon’s reporting solution focused on two key capabilities for the company and its executives: Re-engineering the company’s data to quickly and efficiently generate analytics and visualizations. This enabled executives to load dashboards with key metrics and interactive visualizations on demand Creating four state-of-the-art, industry-focused Tableau dashboards that track KPIs pertaining to revenue, production, effective headcount and marketer performance As a result, the company has much better access to critical information on the company’s performance and is able to communicate it more effectively to keep different business units and functions in sync.

      "AWS Cloud Migration for ProPharma - Apexon  Smooth Cloud Migration Saves Big Costs for ProPharma Success Story Healthcare Smooth Cloud Migration Saves Big Costs for ProPharma And More Download For the past 20 years, ProPharma Group (ProPharma) has improved the health and wellness of patients by providing advice and expertise that empowers biotech, med device, and pharmaceutical organizations of all sizes to confidently advance scientific breakthroughs and introduce new therapies. As the world’s largest RCO (Research Consulting Organization), ProPharma partners with its clients through an advise-build-operate model across the complete product lifecycle. With deep domain expertise in regulatory sciences, clinical research solutions, quality and compliance, pharmacovigilance, medical information, and R&D technology, ProPharma offers an end-to-end suite of fully customizable consulting solutions that de-risk and accelerate our partner’s most high-profile drug and device programs. As ProPharma has grown, it has continued to evolve and invest in new ways to make the business more agile and efficient. One of those investments has been AWS cloud infrastructure – with the goal of enabling increased innovation and faster cycle time, while also reducing costs and security risks. 2,500+ professionals worldwide 1,160 specialized degrees 1,000 active biotech, pharma, medical device and diagnostic clients In late 2021, coming out of the pandemic, ProPharma was consolidating its physical offices to adjust to the increased level of hybrid work situations at the company. As part of this plan, it intended to migrate its on-prem systems to the AWS cloud around the same time. ProPharma has thousands of users accessing its applications, and they could not afford any downtime during the migration. To help assure a smooth transition, they engaged Apexon. ProPharma’s team valued Apexon’s extensive experience with cloud infrastructure, and AWS in particular. They felt Apexon could help them design the right technical approach and migration strategy to minimize disruption to their business and ensure long term success on the AWS platform. The customer journey The first step in the project was for Apexon and ProPharma to jointly conduct a detailed value assessment to highlight how the transition from on-prem infrastructure to AWS cloud would reduce the company’s operational and maintenance costs. With the value clearly established, Apexon worked closely with the ProPharma team to help plan and migrate the on-prem infrastructure of ProPharma to the AWS cloud. The first phase of the project took 5 months to complete since its inception. Detailed discovery and assessment, mobilization, migration execution, and the steady state transition were planned and executed successfully within this time frame. Apexon also helped ProPharma plan for auctioning and safely disposing of its physical infrastructure. Cloud Platform Selection AWS was the obvious choice for ProPharma given its existing relationship with AWS and the platform’s architectural principles, built-in best practices, and design. Discovery and Assessment Apexon worked with the ProPharma team to ensure a complete understanding of its technology environment. This helped in the development of a dependency analysis, capacity plan, and migration strategy. Mobilization The AWS account structure, landing zone architecture, VPC design, on-prem connectivity, and migration blueprint were designed and implemented during this phase. Migration Execution The migration waves were planned and executed based on application dependencies. AWS Cloud Endure was used as a tool to lift and shift the on-premises servers and DMS for migrating the data. The detailed cut-over plan was prepared and discussed with all stakeholders for seamless production migration. Post Migration Operational readiness and ongoing support were key to a successful migration. The joint Apexon/ProPharma migration team implemented automation on monitoring, backup, patching, log file management, and the operation runbook. The joint team also implemented the required controls to ensure security posture and cost optimization. “Our strength with Apexon is in the team relationship. They provide a lot of unique expertise where we need it. But more importantly, they’ve become part of the team here at ProPharma with the same level of commitment to the success of the project that we have. We really value that about them.” Joe Donnici Chief Information Officer, ProPharma Group The Solution Together, Apexon & the ProPharma team developed a migration strategy As ProPharma prepared to consolidate its physical locations and move its compute workloads to the AWS cloud, it wanted to ensure a smooth and efficient migration and minimal disruption to the business and users. Once in place, ProPharma’s team also needed strong application security and an effective and intuitive management capability. Together, Apexon and the ProPharma team developed a migration strategy and deployed the appropriate resources to design and architect the AWS landing zone, and then migrate ProPharma’s on-prem servers to the AWS cloud. Migration Strategy Deep dive into project requirements concerning migration to support strategy formulation The migration strategy was formulated jointly based on a detailed assessment of ProPharma’s requirements. This involved discussions on: Approach to connect on-prem architecture to the cloud Priorities defined for migrating servers based on their types Types of databases to be migrated and their users Need for scalability or load balancing of infrastructure Selection between lift and shift and cloud-native migration Active information on servers like IPs, subnets, and security groups Approach for monitoring cloud migration activities Data encryption for the security of information Implementation of server security with firewalls for internet-facing machines Server Migration to Cloud Cloud migration managed by AWS CloudEndure that allowed movement of servers in test mode before cloud takeover Apexon helped ProPharma set up a new network from the ground up and added cloud migration services. AWS CloudEndure was used to migrate servers to the cloud as it negated the need for ProPharma to change servers. The steps involved include: Creating account structure and landing zone implementation based on the proposed architecture Setting-up VPN connection between on-prem and cloud Setting up CloudEndure for the lift and shift migration Installing CloudEndure agent on-prem and synching with the project Changing the blueprint as per migration needs on CloudEndure Moving servers to AWS in the test mode Migrating databases to AWS using cloud-native migration tools, ensuring the performance and scalability of AWS Setting up and configuring cloud monitoring, logging, and notification functionality using CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Security Hub, Guard Duty, AWS Audit Manager, and SNS Cutting over and disconnecting on-prem servers Performing operational readiness review and preparing runbook and process documents for steady state support AWS SERVICES USED: Amazon EC2 AWS Auto Scaling Amazon RDS Amazon S3 Amazon Route 53 Amazon CloudFront AWS WAF Amazon CloudWatch AWS CloudTrail AWS Certificate Manager AWS SecurityHub AWS GuardDuty AWS KMS AWS Organisations AWS Inspector ELB AWS SNS CloudEndure Key Outcomes Together, the joint Apexon/ProPharma team produced several important results: Disaster Recovery Provision Disaster recovery set-up for some servers High Availability Cloud-enabled high availability of servers Cost Optimization The cost of server maintenance was reduced as the physical infrastructure was not needed to be maintained Enhanced Security Data and infrastructure protection mechanisms like security group, IAM (identity and access management), network access control, and CloudTrail enhanced security posture \n",

The insurance industry is highly competitive. Customer engagement and retention are driven increasingly by exemplary customer service and modern digital experiences. Successful carriers make it as simple as possible for customers to go online and get a new quote and purchase a policy of their choosing. The company engaged Apexon to help diagnose the problem and address the challenges in the user experience that were causing session abandonment. Founded in 1997, one of the first companies to enable customers to purchase home insurance directly online, during a single visit Financial-strength rating of “Excellent” from A.M.

Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time The challenge Improve the user experience & user conversion The insurer’s Digital Optimization team first identified where users were abandoning their sessions. They found that users often began the checkout process after receiving an agreeable quote, but were exiting the application shortly before paying for it. Apexon quickly got to work examining the user experience, specifically the steps leading up to the common drop-off point. The Solution Complete redesign of the buying process Apexon recommended redesigning the entire buying process including an overhaul of the policy review, payment methods, and sign-up pages. The client’s designers needed a frontend React developer to bring the solution to life to test their idea. Apexon’s developers were able to create new components in the client’s existing code base that could be used in the variant pages. Optimizely, the client’s digital experience platform of choice, also came into play by splitting user traffic into two groups. One group would see the original version of the checkout process while the other group would see the newly implemented checkout process. Metrics were also added on Optimizely to track user conversions through each page of the checkout process. The beneficial impact of the redesign was very clear. In just one month, the client saw an increase of over 8%, equating to more than $800,000 in additional premiums. \n",

Translating that value proposition to an online world with an optimal customer experience proved to be a challenge without substantial investment. So, the client engaged Apexon to help them plot a path forward. Founded in 1976 in Nova Scotia, Canada Serving north American and the Caribbean Over 60 staff; 30,000+ square foot manufacturing facility the Results Key Outcomes A NEW MODERN ECOMMERCE EXPERIENCE INCREASED CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT ONLINE FASTER SALES CYCLES, REDUCED COSTS, HIGHER REVENUES The challenge A DISCONNECTED COMMERCE EXPERIENCE HURTS CUSTOMER RETENTION The client had struggled to connect its customer’s journey between its corporate website and ecommerce portal. Each existed on its own, with little/no integration between the two. This created a static experience with no dynamic elements to help the customer move along in their buying and engagement process. For example: Its ERP system could not pull data automatically for order processing A basic contact form led to piecemeal information and incomplete customer acquisition information A lack of credit card payment options disappointed customers and created an outdated image for the entire company Manual accumulation and processing of data caused meaningful delays in analysis, decisions, and actions No shipping services were available, slowing the sales process and frustrating customers All these factors disrupted the customer buying experience, causing a high rate of site abandonment, poor customer retention, and declining revenues.

      "ML Solution Helps Printing Co Save Millions in Shipping Cost  ML Solution Helps Printing Co Save Millions in Shipping Cost Success Story High Tech MACHINE LEARNING SOLUTION HELPS PRINTING COMPANY SAVE MILLIONS IN SHIPPING COSTS Automated processes and unsupervised learning algorithms optimize packing and distribution Download Over the last decade, Apexon has had an ongoing relationship with a large printing and distribution company. The customer produces and mails catalogs, retail inserts, magazines and books for its clients, an undertaking that sees more than six billion physical items shipped every year. Distribution and logistics have long been a focus for digital transformation, even more so when you consider the volume of physical mail, marketing collateral and commercial material that is sent out every day. And while bulk mail is the result, distributing printed B2C assets is often impacted by how much they cost to ship. As part of its commitment to lower overall postage costs, the company encourages its customers to join a co-operative mail program. This program is a key part of the process, allowing the company to combine participating customer orders in one batch and distribute them more efficiently across the delivery ecosystem. However, the sheer volume of physical products often meant that shipping costs exceeded printing costs. In addition, the batches of printed material had a staggering number of postal configurations, all of which increased both the number of hours spent in assembling the batches themselves and the varying shipping costs associated with timely distribution. Prints and distributes 6 billion catalogs and magazines annually ML saved over $70 million in operational costs Delivered solution won industry award for AI excellence Faced with this challenge, the company tasked Apexon with developing a solution that could not only reduce the total shipping costs but also optimize the batched materials into workable configurations for distribution. Apexon’s solution to the problem was to introduce data and analytics into the mix, with an internal team leveraging machine learning to solve the demonstrated pain points. Thanks to the 10-year involvement with this company, the delivered solution has already been beneficial. By using artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve the configuration and batching problems, the client will be able to save more than $70 million, while an optimized configuration can be identified in less than 90 minutes. In addition, the innovative use of AI/ML in a real-world problem saw Apexon receive an Artificial Intelligence Excellence Award from the Business Intelligence Group. the Results Key Outcomes Demonstrated Cost Savings AI/ML integration will save the company more than $70 million in operational costs Optimized configuration process Optimal material batch size and configuration for distribution identified in 90 minutes or less Co-operative mail program Maximized savings through ML will allow company to offer competitive fees and increase customer satisfaction Efficient process = new customers + increased growth opportunities Automation alleviates distribution delays and batch mis-configuration Our methodology how we did it Apexon works with companies across the digital lifecycle. Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Be digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Launch & Experiment Automate & Accelerate Be Intelligent & Autonomous Launch & Experiment Enable digital adoption in a quick, and agile manner Data & Analytics was the platform for a custom machine learning program designed to find not only the choke points in the process – in this case, equipment configuration and material batching – but also enhance the distribution and logistics requirements of those materials. Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Automated processes via machine learning algorithms were a critical part of the cost savings achieved and the optimization of the logistics costs. By saving the customer more than $6 million every year, these savings can be applied to internal programs directed to the customer’s customer. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time Integrated unsupervised learning algorithms to find patterns in the data. This allowed the customer to understand where cost savings could be achieved, and customer satisfaction increased. The challenge REDUCE SHIPPING COSTS, INCREASE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY IN BATCH CONFIGURATION Commercial mail delivery is often offered to companies at reduced rates by third parties such as the U.S. Postal Service or specialized vendors. However, those costs can quickly mount up when the number of items being batched and dispatched run into the thousands per consignment. In the case of the printing and distribution company, the shipping costs not only formed a large part of the operational expenses, but also exceeded the total printing costs of a project. As part of its cooperative mailing program, the company worked with a third-party vendor to deliver the printed materials to customers, a partnership that relied on the discounts that said vendor could provide for presorted bulk mail. The Problem These printed materials ended up being a variety of sizes and batch configurations. This meant that the company had to continually set its onsite packaging equipment to create the bundles required for the vendor. In addition, the number of potential configurations made it almost impossible to come up with the optimal batch in not only a timely fashion but also one that could take advantage of the discounted rates. Apexon’s brief was therefore simple; find a way to shrink the number of possible configurations down to a smaller, workable set of optimal ones and select the best configuration from this smaller set, considering both equipment and timing constraints. The Solution INTEGRATION OF MACHINE LEARNING INTO CONFIGURATION AND DISTRIBUTION The data and analytics team determined that a custom machine learning solution was the best way to achieve desired outcomes. Data being generated by the batching process would follow certain patterns. The key element was to find those patterns and apply them to the optimization metrics required. In this case, the team used unsupervised learning algorithms to find and group unusual patterns – for example, the constant equipment configurations and the batched material cost requirements. Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is the ideal way to integrate an automated process into logistics as it relies on methods that do not have “labeled’ data. In other words, it looks for patterns that do not rely on human input. The algorithms can then group items such as equipment configuration that generate cost savings for distribution and apply that to the items to be batched. This approach allowed the client to configure the packaging equipment to group batches of printed material for third party distribution. The algorithms work in tandem, feeding each other with outputs that optimize the solution and look for ways to improve it beyond the original brief. For example, there were two types of algorithms working together – one genetic (simulating natural selection) and one hierarchical clustering algorithm with structural constraints (introduced to group the printed material into the most optimal for mail carrier routes). This tag teaming of algorithms thereby allowed the company to optimize equipment configuration and cost savings in one single process. Partnership Platforms/Software PROBLEM + CHALLENGE = SOLUTION As distribution and logistics becomes ever more digitalized, companies that can optimize machine learning capabilities to reduce the time spent batching physical products will be a vital part of the ecosystem. The solution for this printing and distribution company was designed to maximize the opportunities that automated processes can offer, with the optimized configuration time reduced to less than 90 minutes. That leads to two defined results: The time spent on equipment configuration and material batching is more attuned to the requirements of the customer. The operational cost savings generated by machine learning and/or automated processes means that the company can offer its customers competitive pricing for those that join its cooperative mail program and, importantly, increase customer satisfaction via a more efficient distribution strategy. \n",

The challenge To provide a high-quality user experience Customer-facing app for iOS & android The company was having difficulty providing a high-quality user experience for customers using their consumer-facing app for iOS and Android. Poor app store ratings made their problems obvious. Test management and turnaround times for new software updates were slow, as only one app update was being released every three months. When the updates were released, they were often out of sync and not functioning properly due to different geographies’ lack of unified communication. enterprise group meeting application The company was also searching for a way to improve their enterprise group meeting application, which was used to guide member group meetings and sell products. Group leaders had to use their laptops in meetings in order to check in members one at a time, and also had to use their laptops to sell and place orders for products other group members had purchased. This system was less than ideal, with various cables connected to bar code scanners and no organized, central purchasing procedure. The Solution utilising applied design thinking plus ® Apexon engaged with the company initially to address the inconsistencies and deliver a higher-quality app to its members. Apexon used Applied Design Thinking Plus ® to derive an implementable solution.

The challenge TO overcome time restrictions to complete project goal Implementing a Hybrid Strategy Initially, InterMiles planned to develop a brand new native mobile capability that incorporated all aspects of its offerings: airline and hotel bookings, membership tier status, rewards and incentives. However, the time requirements for that approach did not align with the planned brand launch. Accomplishing InterMiles’ goal required a hybrid strategy that would enable it to get to market on time by combining native mobile UX for select member interactions with existing web experience for others where it did not impact the UX. Scalable & Cost-Effective Cloud-Native InterMiles also needed a scalable and cost-effective cloud-native option for their compute workload. Usage patterns spiked based on marketing campaign activity and it needed a solution that could scale up and down with that demand. Assuring the performance of their loyalty management platform was crucial to improving lifetime member value. The Solution Formulating a hybrid approach When Apexon started working with InterMiles, the engagement covered multiple aspects of the new mobile experience, starting with assessing the situation and developing the strategy for its hybrid approach. This involved several key decisions in concert with the InterMiles team: The existing loyalty/booking engine was an important middle ground between access to existing member information and activity, and the new UX. Certain aspects had to be retained, and others had to be developed as part of the native mobile experience. InterMiles wanted to ensure multi-channel business continuity and smooth customer experience so active user sessions were carried forward seamlessly as they moved from the native mobile UX to the existing web UX. This required a seamless handshake between the new native app and the existing web view. Additionally, the tight project timeline had to incorporate user feedback throughout the development process. This included the core team, main stakeholders, employees, and extended user groups, both internal and external. The Apexon team then turned its focus to developing and launching both iOS and Android applications quickly and efficiently in line with the launch of the InterMiles brand. The hybrid approach cut the original project timeline by 67%. By leveraging native mobile for the highest priority interactions and web views for lesser interactions, InterMiles was able to deliver an outstanding user experience for both existing and prospective members. It used native web UX for initial levels of interaction; e.g., new user engagement, onboarding, profile updates and search initiation, and maintained web UX for ensuing interactions; e.g., search results, and bookings. The key was ensuring a seamless experience between native and web using tokens, cookies and 3rd  party libraries. There were several key tenets core to the Apexon approach: User experience, value-added content and engagement were also of utmost importance to the InterMiles brand transformation. Apexon worked with the InterMiles team to deliver an experience that reinforced the new brand and its full value proposition for travelers: Simplified Enrollment and Login – made member access frictionless Gamification & Interactivity – increased member engagement and reinforced app use Member-Exclusive Offers – along with special-tier benefits further incented use and engagement Referral Programs – encouraged social sharing and increased visibility Instant Account Updates – provided on-the-go notifications of reward credits, debits and status Easy Reward Redemption – enabled members to collect and redeem awards for flights, hotels, shipping and fuel For InterMIles, the new mobile experience reinforced their fresh, new brand image and helped reshape existing and prospective member’s views about what the company had to offer. Apexon helped support this goal by enabling InterMiles to get to market more quickly with an outstanding user experience. Member engagement increased almost immediately, and satisfaction levels were extremely high based on member feedback. Equally important, InterMiles had the digital foundation that enabled it to scale the mobile channel quickly and flexibly as its member base grew. Our joint approach AWS Cloud InterMiles was a long-time AWS customer and wanted to build on its existing AWS environment. Apexon leveraged its AWS expertise to help it do just that: Developed a micro-services architecture based on JAVA APIs to support mobile and web applications hosted on the Amazon ECS cluster. Scaling policies are defined in such a way that whenever there is a demand for one or more services, only those services are scaling up for optimal resource utilization. Leveraging the auto-scaling feature of Amazon Aurora to support unexpected spikes in the usage. Using Amazon Elasticache (Redis) to store API response temporarily to improve response time and user experience. Using the Kibana dashboard to monitor the performance, failures of the APIs and report anomalies in the ecosystem. AWS Well-Architected Review Apexon introduced AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAR Program) to InterMiles. AWS WAR defines key concepts, design principles and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the AWS cloud. Using WAR, the Apexon team helped InterMiles identify how well their architecture aligned with these best practices and provided guidance for improvements. Key areas of focus included: War pillars Focus areas risk identified Impact War pillars Operational Excellence Focus areas Running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improving processes and procedures risk identified 2+ High risk issues Impact Configuration management solution War pillars Security Focus areas Protecting information and systems risk identified 3+ High risk issues Impact Annual expectancy cost due to security breaches War pillars Reliability Focus areas Ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently risk identified 2+ High risk issues Impact Disaster recovery architecture War pillars Performance Efficiency Focus areas Using IT and computing resources efficiently risk identified 3+ High risk issues Impact Application performance workflow War pillars Cost Optimization Focus areas Avoiding unnecessary costs risk identified High risk issues Impact Cost-intensive resources by tagging and using optimization techniques Key Outcomes from aws war review Identified and fixed high-risk issues Concerning performance, operations, reliability, security and cost, with significant improvement in customer engagement and lifetime value. Employed new AWS services Addressing high-risk issues observed during the discovery phase. Enabled continuous monitoring and automation For tasks with high impact on mission-critical functions.

      "Transformation via Agile & Salesforce  Transformation via Agile & Salesforce Success Story Manufacturing Transformation via Agile & Salesforce Apexon increases productivity by 400%  and improves the customer experience Download This large, publicly-traded modular manufacturing company is North America’s leading site solutions provider — specializing in custom mobile offices, storage, classrooms, and more. The company faced two distinct and unrelated challenges in the business. One was a productivity problem due to a lack of communication across business units caused by siloed work structures. This led to poor strategic planning, inefficient resource and staff allocation, and friction between departments. North America’s leading site solutions provider ~160,000 modular units of all types A large fleet of quality mobile offices and portable storage units The other was inefficient marketing execution and poor customer service. The company had tried to help address this by implementing Salesforce Experience Cloud for their customer service team and front-line field representatives, but adoption of the system was underwhelming. As a result, the sales team continued to capture sales activities on paper, making it difficult to optimize marketing and customer interactions. The company engaged Apexon to help them address both problems, separately. the Results Key Outcomes 400% increase in organizational productivity Increased cost savings & project success rates Strong Salesforce adoption leading to more effective customer service Our methodology how we did it Apexon works with companies across the digital lifecycle. Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Be digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Launch & Experiment Automate & Accelerate Be Intelligent & Autonomous Launch & Experiment Enable digital adoption in a quick, and agile manner Apexon helped build a customer community portal for the company’s external users. Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Apexon helped the company shift its product development process from Waterfall to Agile. All staff received training on Agile practices so they could deliver incrementally to accelerate progress, learn from their mistakes faster, and gather valuable insights to improve the process. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time The challenge Productivity & customer service Poor Productivity – Getting to the Root Cause The company was simply struggling to get work out the door. In 2019, it only completed 3 major projects; a small number given its size. The problem was siloed work structures and a lack of communication across business units. This led to inefficient resource and staff allocation. In addition, a recent merger further aggravated the problem, and created additional friction between departments. A new approach was required – and it had to take into account both the project management process and the role of IT in addressing the problem. Poor Customer Service Execution Entirely separate from its productivity problems, the company had invested in over 2,300 Salesforce Service Cloud licenses to support its front line field representatives, but these employees never logged into the system. They had originally intended to use the Salesforce to support sales deals, launch marketing campaigns, and manage customer service. But the majority of the field reps continued to record their activities on paper. Not only were they overspending on unused Salesforce licenses, but customer service issues kept arising from the long paper trail. The company lacked a streamlined approach for order tracking to keep the front line updated about shipments. As a result, the company was losing vital customer information and inaccurately recording sales histories. The company needed a better way to track customer feedback, signatures, orders, and deliveries. The Solution Productivity – A new IT powered approach to increase transparency & communication Apexon began with comprehensive discovery sessions to understand where communication was breaking down and impeding productivity. The solution was a new IT-led structure focused on communication and transparency. This gave the IT team a much larger voice in evaluating the feasibility and ROI of technology projects and equipping staff with the right tools. The company shifted its product development process from Waterfall to Agile. All staff received training on Agile practices so they could deliver incrementally to accelerate progress, learn from their mistakes faster, and gather valuable insights to improve the process. Most importantly, the IT department learned how to communicate the status of IT projects to all of the company’s departments, accelerating the flow of information to better align decision making and staffing across the customer care organization. Agile Development Some of the key outcomes of the productivity initiative included: Increased transparency & project efficiency Each department better understands one another’s priorities, enabling them to synch project planning and eliminate redundancy and waste Easily measured ROI A 400% increase in productivity in less than half the time Increased cost savings & success rates By increasing transparency and communication, end product is finalized quicker and more efficiently Marketing, Sales, & Service Execution Apexon’s solution was to build a customer self-service portal for customers and external field reps. This served as a forcing mechanism for the company’s employees by eliminating the paper trail and changing the process of creating, tracking, and updating service appointments into a digitized approach. Users formed “virtual communities” which offered personalized customer care. They were able to share information and weigh in on best approaches and answers to problems – fostering community building around common needs and subject areas. As a result, the company gained several key benefits: Big monthly cost savings By converting its 2,300 Salesforce user licenses to Customer Experience Cloud licenses and deflecting contact center traffic An easy-to-use customer experience portal Similar to popular tracking portals like FedEx and UPS – to drive customer self service Creation of a virtual community Complete with automated chat bots, support services, and personalized customer care Improved customer service Immediate assistance for users; a robust knowledge base to disseminate articles on troubleshooting common problems \n",

This meant rolling out new web and mobile services more quickly and efficiently. The bank’s end goal was to minimize the risk of delays and rework and gain a higher degree of confidence to ship code more frequently. But they faced several obstacles including: Linear and siloed development efforts Which hampered the build process and created the need for rework in the later stages of development Highly manual testing processes Which further slowed cycle times and increased the risk of errors and inconsistent service quality Disparate tools and methodologies Used across the organization, creating huge inefficiencies and redundancies No source code management system Resulting in multiple code bases, further slowing development and testing Lack of non-functional testing Across different stages of the software development lifecycle The Solution digital engineering and digital quality assurance Apexon’s engagement was focused on two primary initiatives: digital engineering and digital quality assurance. The goal was to transform the bank’s application delivery processes to address its challenges organization-wide.

Multiple ERPs were sourced from one site, making it inherently complex to apply any divisional process changes. In addition, there was a growing lack of knowledge in the organization about the legacy systems as IT employees involved with the original implementation either retired or moved on to other opportunities inside or outside the company. Working with the existing legacy system presented a number of challenges for the company’s IT team: The system was designed with a hierarchical company model requiring selective execution and multiple iterations for every division of the company. This delayed implementation of any required changes Web pages were not SEO-optimized when it came to products and categories.

Its worldwide network, technology-backed support model and extensive knowledge of international shipping requirements provide a seamless experience with delivery reliability, accuracy and consistency.Part of this company’s success is dependent on its ability to integrate its logistics platform with 3rd party delivery vendors all over the world. This impacts its ability to onboard those vendors, add new services, and manage customer shipping costs. As it outgrew its existing technology services vendor, this company turned to Apexon to help map out its digital path forward. 25 years of experience in international shipping and logistics Spinoff from R.R. Donnelly in 2020 Four strategically located logistics centers in the US The customer journey 2019 2020 2021 2022 2019 Start of engagement 2020 Stabilization of existing logistics platform, development partner for new services Spinoff from R.R. Donnelly, additional services 2021 Migration to Azure 2022 Continued application development partner the Results Key Outcomes At the close of the project, Apexon was able to deliver the following features and upgrades to the customer’s hiring and talent processing systems: Increased uptime for mission criticaL applications Reduced operational downtime Increased throughput of warehouse operations Expanded services for customers Enhanced data insights & reporting The challenge Finding the Right Digital Partner to Keep Pace with Market Dynamics This company was formerly part of R.R. Donnelly’s Global Logistics division. And prior to 2019 it was working with another technology services vendor for development. As the company grew, this technology services vendor was struggling to keep pace, causing critical time-to-market delays for new services, hampering system maintenance and scalability, impacting service levels, and slowing the growth of the business. At the time, Apexon was working with other groups within R.R. Donnelly Global Logistics and had a very strong track record for digital innovation, quality, and delivery. That led the company’s team to engage Apexon to help define a path forward with two primary objectives: Enable to business to move more quickly by eliminating production, maintenance and scalability issues Provide the ability to easily add new services and capabilities that would continue to differentiate its service offering and enable expansion into new delivery markets around the world This company partners with many different vendors in different countries around the world. Each new vendor requires a new integration. This had become very difficult with its existing platform. New integrations would break existing features and slow partner and customer onboarding. Addressing this challenge was key to the company’s success. The ability to add new services like least-cost routing, warehouse automation, parcel tracking, and automated reporting and analytics were also important to help the company maintain and extend its leadership position. At the time, the company’s platform was running on-premise on legacy infrastructure. This added to the challenges and complexity of 3rd party vendor integrations, the addition of new services and functionality, and ongoing system maintenance and scalability. The Solution A Flexible Cloud-Based Platform to Accelerate Development & Enhance Service Levels Apexon’s engagement with the company was centered on digital engineering and data & analytics. Our approach involved an onsite/offshore delivery model with a dedicated Scrum Master working closely with the client. The team was organized into three groups focused on the company’s primary goals: Digital Engineering Making the existing platform more stable and preventing ongoing maintenance and operation problems Application Development Delivering new features and developments to enhance service levels Infrastructure Enhance the scalability and performance of the platform with a focus on infrastructure The first step was to stabilize the company’s existing platform. Apexon initiated a new DevOps process to insert quality engineering earlier in the development process. This in combination with Apexon’s technical expertise, brought immediate improvements to platform performance and cycle time for system updates and maintenance. Next Apexon helped the company add least-cost routing and package tracking capabilities to the platform. These were important features that were in high demand from customers. Both of these capabilities involved complex integrations with all of its third-party providers. In late 2020, this company was spun off from R.R. Donnelly as a separate business. This created the need to re-think its IT infrastructure and the opportunity to optimize it for its business going forward. With Apexon’s guidance, the decision was made to move the the company’s logistics platform to Azure Cloud. This offered a number of important benefits – reduced CapEx and maintenance costs, increased speed and flexibility in adding new features, streamlined integration with new shipping partners around the world, and enhanced data reporting capabilities. Apexon handled the migration of all existing applications to Azure including its vendor integration framework. It also immediately shifted all new development work to Azure. This effort included selecting the right supporting infrastructure and database. Apexon also continued to assist in new feature development and expansion: Parcel management, sorting and routing in warehouses were critical capabilities for the company and they required enormous manual effort. Apexon developed software to automate warehouse conveyor belt functions to speed up labeling, and automate existing sorting capabilities In advance of the company opening its new logistics facility in Miami in June 2022, Apexon was behind the scenes, making sure it was online and ready to go into full production Apexon continues today as a development partner of this company– making continuous improvements to its Azure-based logistics platform, adding new service features, and ensuring easy onboarding of new partners. Outcomes The results to date for this company have been significant: Incorporation of a best practice Agile software development model across the business A streamlined IT department due to a more stable platform and simpler partner integrations Stabilized applications to increase uptime Automation of previously manual parcel shipment processes in warehouses Enhanced data insights and reporting Launched mission critical applications increasing organizational throughput Enabled better foresight and IT investment Began data engineering and reporting to lay foundation for future expansion Migrated on-premise infrastructure to Azure cloud – reducing CapEx and maintenance costs, increasing speed and flexibility in adding new features, and streamlining integration with new shipping partners around the world, and enhancing data reporting capabilities \n",

Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Be digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Launch & Experiment Automate & Accelerate Be Intelligent & Autonomous Launch & Experiment Enable digital adoption in a quick, and agile manner Apexon helped Wirecard extend their business in the fast-growing wearables payment market with minimal risk. Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Apexon provided a platform for mobile development and QE that enabled the company to address the different technical complexities and requirements of various wearable devices, payment platforms and communication protocols. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time Apexon put a data engineering infrastructure in place for Wirecard, providing its merchant clients with new, high- value services to help grow their business. The challenge TO overcome technical obstacles Wearables Application At the time wearables represented the latest in payment technology and customer convenience. The category was projected to grow by as much as 60% between 2016 and 2020. There were simple wearables in the form of passive bands with EMV contactless chips and smart wearables designed for everyday use featuring data display, NFC and BLE connectivity, long battery life and a variety of device-specific functionality. Wirecard needed to support both types and devices and connect them to its consumer credit card and pre-paid card issuing platforms. The company also needed to ensure secure data flow between the wearables and those platforms and meet all PCI compliance requirements. Data Engineering and Analytics Wirecard was sitting on top of an enormous amount of valuable payment data and saw an opportunity to help its merchants with value-added data services that could inform loyalty programs, help identify opportunities for upsell and cross-sell, and construct more intelligent pricing strategies and product placements. But it did not have the necessary expertise in data engineering and analytics. Additionally, an increasing portion of the data it was receiving from its merchant customers was unstructured, making it very difficult to analyze.

The client on helping people become their best selves by offering a comprehensive assortment of vitamins, minerals, sports nutrition, herbs, superfoods, and more. Apexon engaged with the client to modernize the company’s cloud infrastructure to improve its ability to support its Kubernetes-based software development, IT services and business operations. Apexon helped select a new cloud infrastructure solution and managed a seamless migration of its Kubernetes environment to the new platform. the Results Key Outcomes Record-breaking Cyber Monday sales 50% year-over-year increase in sales on events like Black Friday Elevated customer satisfaction and loyalty through an enhanced omnichannel CX The challenge Optimizing Cloud Infrastructure and Reducing Complexity Involved with Kubernetes As the company had grown, it had embraced cloud and containers in its approach to infrastructure and software development. Its container solution of choice, Kubernetes, offered the organization a number of advantages by making its applications and workloads more portable between different machines and environments, enabling the rapid scaling of containerized applications across multiple servers or multiple clusters, and supporting best practices such as CI/CD and DevOps. As its use of Kubernetes increased though, its cloud platform faced challenges to support it on multiple levels, e.g.: Networking complexity Kubernetes requires a well-designed and well-managed network infrastructure to function effectively.  This was challenging due to the complexity of network configurations, including load balancing, firewalls, and virtual private clouds (VPCs). Cluster setup and configuration Setting up a Kubernetes cluster on its existing cloud platform required a deep understanding of its networking and security features, as well as Kubernetes itself. This was a challenge for the client which did not have extensive experience in these areas. Scaling and resource management Kubernetes makes it easy to scale applications up or down based on demand. However, managing and optimizing resources, such as CPU and memory, was challenging with complex workloads. Availability and uptime Maintaining high availability and uptime for Kubernetes clusters on its existing cloud platform required careful planning and configuration. Monitoring and logging Monitoring clusters required a robust logging and monitoring infrastructure. This included setting up logging and monitoring tools that could provide visibility into the health and performance of the Kubernetes cluster and its applications. Security and compliance Its existing cloud platform offered a wide range of security and compliance features, but configuring network policies, access controls, and monitoring for Kubernetes was problematic. Upgrades and maintenance Upgrading Kubernetes required ensuring that all components, such as the Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes, were upgraded in a timely and coordinated manner to avoid downtime or other issues. With all these challenges, the client engaged with Apexon to help chart a path forward and select a new cloud platform. It had experience working with Apexon in other areas of its business, and it valued Apexon’s expertise in cloud, migration and Kubernetes. The client felt that this would help minimize the risk and complexity associated with migrating its Kubernetes clusters to a new environment, while also ensuring a smooth and efficient transition. The Solution AWS Cloud Infrastructure Platform Optimized for Container-Based Environments Apexon started by assessing the client’s current Kubernetes deployment to understand the specific process and performance bottlenecks and identify the right cloud infrastructure solution. Together, the decision was made to go with AWS, based on several reasons: AWS’s vast global network of data centers could provide better network performance and lower latency.  It also offers a more extensive range of services and configurations, allowing the client to tailor its infrastructure to its specific needs. Lastly, AWS offers a range of cost optimization tools, such as AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets, to help manage and optimize costs for the client’s Kubernetes clusters. Equally important, AWS addressed the primary issues the client was having with its existing cloud platform: Networking complexity AWS offers a more straightforward and intuitive networking configuration to help simplify the setup and management of Kubernetes clusters. AWS’ range of network services, such as VPCs, load balancing, and security groups, are also easier to configure than on its existing cloud platform. Cluster setup and configuration AWS provides a range of managed Kubernetes services, such as Amazon EKS and EKS Anywhere, which simplify the setup and management of Kubernetes clusters. This includes a wide range of documentation, tutorials, and best practices for deploying and managing Kubernetes on AWS. Scaling and resource management AWS offers a wide range of scalable computing and storage services, such as EC2 and EBS, to help organizations manage and optimize resources for Kubernetes clusters. Availability and uptime AWS’s high availability and fault-tolerant services, such as multi-AZ deployments, would help ensure the availability and uptime of Kubernetes clusters. Security and compliance AWS provides a range of security features, such as encryption, access control, and regulatory compliance, which would help the client configure and manage security for its Kubernetes clusters. Monitoring and logging AWS offers a wide range of monitoring and logging tools, such as CloudWatch and CloudTrail, that provide visibility into the health, security and performance of Kubernetes clusters and their applications. Upgrades and maintenance AWS provides a range of tools and services, such as AWS Systems Manager and AWS OpsWorks, that can help organizations manage upgrades and maintenance for Kubernetes clusters. Apexon assisted the client on multiple aspects of the migration: Migration Planning Apexon played a pivotal role in collaboratively planning the migration, addressing the client’s unique business requirements. The team anticipated potential challenges and formulated a comprehensive strategy to ensure a seamless transition.

The Challenge A Struggle with Efficiency and Customer Experience Our customer, a prominent player in the BFSI sector , grappled with several challenges that impacted both customer experience and operational efficiency. Here’s a closer look at the key hurdles they faced: High Volume of Customer Complaints Customer struggled to keep up with the sheer volume of customer complaints. Manual processes for summarizing and analyzing these complaints made it difficult to identify trends and address issues promptly, potentially leading to frustrated customers. IVR Frustration Their existing Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems suffered from high dropout rates, hindering customer service delivery. Understanding the reasons behind these dropouts was crucial for optimizing the IVR experience and improving customer engagement. Transcription Woes The significant increase in call volume created a bottleneck in call transcription and analysis. Manual transcription was not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, hindering company’s ability to extract valuable insights from customer interactions. Dispute Resolution Roadblocks The manual process of responding to customer disputes was labor-intensive and lacked consistency. This approach made it difficult to personalize responses and address customer concerns effectively. These challenges stemmed from two key root causes: 01 Operational Inefficiencies Manual Reliance Client relied heavily on manual processes for tasks like summarizing complaints, analyzing IVR dropouts, and crafting dispute responses. This approach was not only time-consuming and prone to errors, but also limited scalability as their business grew.

The company needed a digital engineering partner to address some key business and technology challenges such as the inability to connect digital health record systems, concerns about patient data security and privacy, and the impersonalization of patient-provider relationships. It also wanted to track the availability and release of controlled substances for pharmacies in its health system to minimize manual errors. Founded in 1945 10M+ members 3 divisions $90B+ Annual Operating Revenues Apexon began work with the company in 2010 and has evolved with the company and worked on many projects during a decade-long relationship that continues to grow. Over this period, Apexon has led the design, development, and delivery of multiple digital healthcare solutions , including integrations to the existing hospital and medical practice systems. Some of the projects also included QA and testing of the applications to ensure optimal performance in use. This partnership enabled the company to launch new insight-driven technology initiatives faster, increasing patient satisfaction by easing access to care, and increasing operational efficiency, resulting in over $5M in cost savings.

Increased patient satisfaction due to ease of access to care and improved experience. Our methodology how we did it With this company, Apexon worked across all stages of the digital lifecycle on multiple projects for two separate business units. Go Digital Accelerating the delivery of new digital initiatives with confidence Be digital Creating the infrastructure and foundation to scale digital initiatives Evolve Digital Leveraging data and analytics to continuously improve digital delivery processes Launch & Experiment Automate & Accelerate Be Intelligent & Autonomous Launch & Experiment Enable digital adoption in a quick and agile manner In an effort to incorporate digital into patient care, Apexon designed and developed remote care interactions using mobile and wearables devices which allowed care providers and patients to communicate on care and diagnosis remotely. Apexon also designed and developed a post-care online survey tool for hospital staff to use with patients for Care Follow-up. The project included the development of a survey authoring tool, end-to-end workflow, and a continuous development and release infrastructure to enable more frequent release cycles for new features. Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale In order to streamline Inventory Management for Controlled Substances Apexon developed an application for automated tracking of the availability and release of controlled substances for pharmacies across this health system. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time To provide better data-driven insight, Apexon developed an Operational Analytics solution that consolidated information about patient capacity and staffing from multiple data sources. This dashboard-in-the-cloud connected to the hospital’s existing systems and devices, enabling staff in different locations to monitor patient needs and align resources with those needs. the challenge TO integrate digital capabilities Digital technologies have had an immensely positive impact on the healthcare industry: streamlined operations and lower costs, easier information access enabling better patient care, and groundbreaking new treatments that can be monitored and managed via cloud, mobile and IoT. This healthcare organization had identified a number of different areas where it wanted to make improvements. Its initial focus was on those use cases where technology could have the greatest impact – for members, doctors, and other staff. But achieving the company’s objectives also required the ability to integrate and tune any new digital capabilities within the unique requirements of the organizations’ existing IT systems and infrastructure. The Solution Working as a team This company had a long-standing relationship with Apexon and had worked with the team on a number of important digital initiatives across different business units. This experience, combined with Apexon’s thought leadership and deep technological expertise had made Apexon its go-to digital services partner. Working together, the company and Apexon identified several key use cases that presented a unique opportunity to provide immediate benefit in the areas of both patient care and resource utilization. Some of these digital initiatives included: Operational Analytics Apexon developed an insight-driven platform for both mobile and web to enable collaboration between various operational teams and medical centers. This helped establish performance outcome metrics to create a retrospective scorecard at the patient level. It was highly granular, yet also had the capacity to roll-up to an operational unit level for use by staff. Remote Care Interactions Apexon created a fully automated and interactive cloud-based voice recognition application platform with a patient-physician, microservice-based interaction model. This solution minimizes the need for patient visits to the hospital, reducing waiting times for appointments, eliminating human errors in the information gathering process and enriching the overall care experience. Care follow-up Apexon provided the technical expertise to design and develop a Survey Authoring Tool (SAT) to help the provider capture patient feedback on their conditions. This involved working with multiple teams from this large healthcare provider to understand the needs of physicians and clinical team members, define key solution requirements and testing the end-to-end workflow from survey creation to member distribution and access. Apexon also created a continuous development and release infrastructure to enable more frequent release cycles for new features and higher service levels. Inventory Management for Controlled Substances Inventory management and procurement was severely constrained due to a resource and time-intensive process to track and log cycle count of all of its out-patient pharmacy centers manually. This also increased the chances for human error and made it difficult to conduct accurate inventory audits. Apexon developed a mobile and web application infrastructure to automate the cycle count functionality of the pharmacy inventory. The platform was integrated with a handheld scanner device, backend microservices, data consumption protocol, and API design pattern with 3rd party systems such as Supplylogix, ePIMS, and Daily Cycle Count Snapshot database. Next Steps developing new initiatives Apexon is currently working with the company on the development and testing of several new initiatives including one related to safer dispensing of prescriptions and another related to more convenient appointment scheduling. \n",

The teams learned to utilize test-driven development, XP (Extreme Programming) practices, behavior-driven techniques, and design patterns in development. Advanced training offered by Apexon helped key resources become Certified Scrum Developers and continue the work of growing and maturing teams within the company. Positive results from the training were seen in as little as 30 days. In addition to increasing the company’s development maturity, its logistics business partners were also gaining new skills in areas such as multi-level release planning, advanced product management, cross-team dependency management, and emergent product design. Combined with a new focus on fast feedback and minimum viable product (MVP), these business partners became better aligned and set the stage for faster product delivery. The effort also paved the way for improvements in environment virtualization, release management, automation (both functional acceptance testing and in build quality verification) and project management. The impact for the company was dramatic: Time-to-market was drastically reduced New projects that previously took 15 months or longer were reduced to fewer than 90 days. And with each new project, this number continues to improve Defects were reduced substantially Software defects, along with the time spent working on them, dropped to record lows and allowed teams to spend more time working on new features Customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores improved significantly The changes were so transformative that the client and Apexon made a joint presentation on the project and the journey involved. “There are lots of companies out there who can help us build some software. Apexon is the only one I’ve seen that is committed to making us better at the same time. That’s a real strategic advantage.” Client’s IT Manager \n",

Automate & Accelerate Build digital infrastructure and foundation for enterprises to scale Apexon and Tricentis were able to integrate QA more closely with development and expand the use of test automation as part of the software delivery pipeline. Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time Key test cases and prerequisites were identified and refined to minimize the need for manual intervention during the QA process thus achieving the end-to-end test automation. The challenge Problems scaling with complex software The company’s operations and service offerings were becoming increasingly software-dependent and at the same time, the demand and complexity of its software delivery was growing. This led to many challenges in its software testing efforts, causing time-to-market delays and operational inefficiencies. With an expanding test footprint and more frequent release schedule, there were no established end-to-end regression testing scenarios before major releases. Release cycles were being extended due to extensive manual testing. There were also production rollbacks due to undetected defects in the QA environment. On top of those challenges, the delivery team faced other testing inefficiencies: Bad test data Duplicate and incomplete test cases Inefficient testing Inability to reuse test scripts Lack of integration and organization Missing test data and not all data was integrated across systems Lack of metrics A lack of automated defect tracking and metrics Cumbersome testing 20 analysts spending 4+ months to test an upgrade Inefficient management Compliance standards that were more difficult to manage, creating additional manual testing requirements The company needed to find a way to improve the testing environment in order to accelerate cycle time and keep pace with the accelerated software delivery schedule. The Solution Optimizing testing with integration and automation Apexon deployed a new continuous delivery and testing approach. Leveraging Tricentis’ continuous testing platform as the foundation, Apexon was able to integrate quality engineering (QE) more closely with development and expand the use of test automation as part of the software delivery pipeline. The outputs from this effort included: Better data management Identification, refinement and management of key test cases and prerequisites. API optimization REST API testing for both functionality and response times. Faster testing Agile testing comprised of two-week sprints. Automation In-sprint automated testing followed by regression/end-to-end testing. Streamlined data Prerequisite data creation as part of the test case execution to minimize the need for manual intervention. Integrations Integration testing and successful Salesforce integrations with SAP, ServiceMax and other common desktop applications. The new QE environment also enabled faster, more continuous feedback on the quality of each release and the potential risks associated with it. Apexon leveraged its experience with key applications such as Salesforce and SAP to speed the company’s integrations and test automation efforts. With end-to-end test automation scenarios in place across their various systems, cycle time and efficiencies dramatically increased, and the products were thoroughly tested before market release. \n",

Be Intelligent & Autonomous Leverage data engineering to make strategic decisions and get digital right every time As a part of continuous evolution, Apexon Execution Pod focused on helping Proteus grow by enabling other innovators to develop applications that could work with the Proteus digital pill & patch. In addition to app enhancements, the Execution Pod developed two SDKs: a BLE-based framework to receive, parse and store patch data in a database, and a Design Mobile Application UI. Apexon also enabled  the continuous tracking of KPIs via the continuous collection of select operational and business data from the project and the abiloity to generate insights from the collected data. The challenge A complex vision Proteus’ product vision was incredibly compelling but executing on that vision was also complex.  The company’s core competence was on the frontend – with breakthrough integrations of technology with medicine and in-patient care. However, they had several critical needs on the backend: Management of regulatory compliance requirements within software product development Short lead times for product launches in multiple geographies Time-to-market challenges that prevented proper discipline across the product lifecycle Bluetooth (BLE) connectivity across multiple devices Greater control of cost of technology infrastructure; desire to move to an on-demand model The ability to scale quickly with the increase in the number of connected medical devices and patient networks The Solution Solving one of the toughest digital engineering challenges Apexon worked with the company across the entire delivery lifecycle: Application Development Apexon enabled the mobile application to communicate continuously via BLE with the patch worn by the patient. Apexon also supported the company on several other development projects including the middleware for the core company application (both Android and iOS), as well as the web frontend portal for the standard patient application. The development team added new UI features, enhanced communication mechanisms, and fixed defects. It also added new features and improved existing features in the Patient & Provider App in a 2-week development sprint. The team worked on the Integration with Google Analytics & Swrve SDK to capture analytics data and with New Relic to capture Application Crush details. Software Verification & Validation Apexon created an end-to-end process to test and QA the entire service offering across the end-to-end application lifecycle. This included: Manual testing of the mobile app Automated testing and QA of the connection of the frontend, backend and middleware Real-life scenarios for testing the mobile app (Patch testing apparatus), physical motion (Step, Incline), medication intake, heartbeat, etc. in addition to generating FDA compliant protocols and documents Apexon also configured & broke BLE signals using Hoffman Box for the interruption testing and the app performance on devices – CPU, Memory usage as a part of Performance Testing . Systems Integration & Device Expansion Apexon set-up a test center to replicate how the systems would operate and communicate with each other in real life. This included end to end integration tests involving Patch, Cloud, App & Backend. Apexon automated test scripting and maintenance during sprint-cycle. The team was able to automate 600 test cases per platform daily for regression tests Cloud Migration Built a  ‘Gap-Analysis’ matrix of Proteus’ cloud requirements and recommended  AWS as the best choice.

As a result of its assessment, Apexon proposed to build a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda. With over 10+ services, Westhill paid only for the execution time of the Lambda functions. In addition, Lambda enabled developers to choose the programming language, further accelerating the delivery timeline and addressing skill gaps in the delivery team.

In this case, the team used unsupervised learning algorithms to find and group unusual patterns – for example, the constant equipment configurations and the batched material cost requirements. Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is the ideal way to integrate an automated process into logistics as it relies on methods that do not have “labeled’ data.

For example, there were two types of algorithms working together – one genetic (simulating natural selection) and one hierarchical clustering algorithm with structural constraints (introduced to group the printed material into the most optimal for mail carrier routes).
