As part of its cooperative mailing program, the company worked with a third-party vendor to deliver the printed materials to customers, a partnership that relied on the discounts that said vendor could provide for presorted bulk mail.

In addition, the number of potential configurations made it almost impossible to come up with the optimal batch in not only a timely fashion but also one that could take advantage of the discounted rates.

Data being generated by the batching process would follow certain patterns. The key element was to find those patterns and apply them to the optimization metrics required. In this case, the team used unsupervised learning algorithms to find and group unusual patterns – for example, the constant equipment configurations and the batched material cost requirements. Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is the ideal way to integrate an automated process into logistics as it relies on methods that do not have “labeled’ data. In other words, it looks for patterns that do not rely on human input.

The algorithms work in tandem, feeding each other with outputs that optimize the solution and look for ways to improve it beyond the original brief. For example, there were two types of algorithms working together – one genetic (simulating natural selection) and one hierarchical clustering algorithm with structural constraints (introduced to group the printed material into the most optimal for mail carrier routes).

The International SOS Travel Tracker was an app used to monitor traveler location for safety.

For example, too many unplanned technology deployments were being pushed into production, making it difficult to keep projects on schedule and assure service quality. There was no Continuous Integration process in place and its development infrastructure was insufficient.

This can offer important costs saving in the long run. Use of Lambda serverless architecture instead of EC2 created significant cost savings. Understanding business requirements, functions, and overall frequency of web traffic is important to ideate and optimize the solution for compute resources and related services. Westhill had a specific ask to design a solution to save cost when there is no web traffic or pay only when traffic is served.

Each element of the UI (a micro frontend) is served as a separate component. Those components are then bundled together in one overall UI (a shell/wrapper). Web Components Each micro frontend is defined as an HTML custom element making it easy to embed any Angular or React component into the shell. These web components easily communicate with other components and the shell and support browser navigation (in the way other single-page application routing works). They also support deep-linking and URL sharing. iFrames iFrames provide a backup to web components and allowed the embedding of a standard HTML document (the micro frontend) inside another HTML

Accelerated software update cycles The micro frontend approach enables Web components to be updated separately. This allows for a breakdown of large changes, such as major upgrades to framework versions, into smaller tasks.

However, key stakeholders didn’t want teams reinventing component libraries every time a framework change was made. Both sides were dedicated to efficiency, but from very different perspectives. Many organizations were looking to maintain consistent branding across applications using a centralized component library. This would reduce overall feature design and development time. However, with projects located around the world with many different teams, there were bound to be differing opinions about which framework best suited the needs of the team. The Solution A new approach to improve development efficiency & developer retention Apexon recommended empowering development teams with a framework-agnostic component library with the help of Direflow – a"

Apexon has found that providing developers the creative freedom that they need improves efficiency and happiness, ultimately yielding accelerated feature timelines and improved developer retention.
